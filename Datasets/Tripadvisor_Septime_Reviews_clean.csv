0,Affordable and Comfortable for an Excellent Meal,kevinboss816,5,2021-09-15,"Excellent meal and service for Americans in Paris. Went for lunch and did the tasting menu and wine pairing. Everything was great, especially the tuna dish. Really enjoyed the casual atmosphere for such a high end restaurant.",2021-09-01,0,5.0,Wednesday,September
1,great for vegetarians,Turner S,761,2021-08-14,"Have been lucky enough to enjoy their food a few times now and I recommend for vegetarians looking for a quality Michelin experience.  Not all dishes were vegetarian, but they can easily adjust the menu if you ask.  They are very accommodating of allergies and...preferences. They made broccoli smell like steak and taste better than broccoli ever has before for me.  At the end of the day, I prefer my meat, but for those who don’t I think you will enjoy Septime.  The wine pairings leaned too heavily of natural wines for my liking, but I did enjoy the orange wines.  Both seem to be trending in Paris in 2021.More",2021-07-01,0,4.0,Saturday,August
2,Spend your money somewhere else.,758shelinas,24,2021-08-06,"We have visited Septime last Tuesday after waiting for a long time. We had this restaurant on our list for forever. We went for a tasting menu with a bottle of wine. We went on a big food trip visiting Ogata, PavYllon, Septime and restaurant...A.T. After having seen the wine list we ordered a bottle of white whereas the waitress came with a bottle of red. No problem, changed in it time. Then the 7 course meal started and that is where it went wrong. The speed of service (starting at 21.20) was way too fast and noticing the hovering service over our empty (or not) plates was beyond polite. As service was already that bad (did not refill our wine glasses once as they are so focused on the empty plates). The food is so-so, when talking about bistro, if we talk about Michelin starred restaurants we aren’t even close to the expectation nor quality of food. We left at 23.00 after finishing the meal at 22.45. We mentioned the fact of speed of service and lack of service. the restaurant manager started to disagree as she told us that this is what the chef wants. Let me be clear about one thing: speed of service is for the host(ess) and not for the chef. We will never come back, what an awful experience with a bill of at least €200.- (just food). This is not a Michelin starred restaurant. Don’t visit. Go to Bouillon Chartier if you want to eat fast. Service is superb there.More",2021-08-01,2,1.0,Friday,August
3,Spectacular - our high expectations were met,bluesky2020a,82,2020-07-27,"We got a reservation at Septime a couple of months after Covid lockdown, after having had in the past not much luck at getting a reservation. We had pretty high expectations, because this place is extremely hyped, but we were very pleasantly surprised that those...expectations were met. The food was spectacular and hands down the best we've had in France in our year here. Highlights were creamed artichoke with blanched almonds, truffle and sumac, an aubergine dish with mushroom jus and cuttlefish, a vegetarian cabbage main with flowers and preserved peppers, and a verbena flower ice cream with honey. An excellent fancy option in France if you are vegetarian. Yum!More",2020-07-01,1,5.0,Monday,July
4,Groumet as I'm used to,Sinyanchway,4,2020-03-10,"We were invited here by our business parter and were surprised by the variety of the French kitchen. I knew that they're special, but this has been excellent. We had several dished of fish, sea food and meat. 
Nicely decorated and made on the point....From fish to meat, everything was like butter and easy to eat and enjoy.More",2020-02-01,3,5.0,Tuesday,March
5,"If you can get a table, you're in for the meal of a lifetime",Sophie F,31,2020-02-21,"Took me years to secure a reservation, but it did not disappoint, even with all the build-up. Very interesting dishes, using ingredients that are so simple into creating truly mind-opening food. Would recommend to anyone in a heartbeat. Could use better wines, some more meat...and we did not get butter (no one did on the night we were there), but apart from that, it is truly everything advertised and more.More",2020-02-01,2,5.0,Friday,February
6,Left disappointed by high expectation,Blaki_devi,87,2020-02-21,"After reading earlier reviews and articles on this restaurant, we came in expecting to be wowed by the flavours of the dishes. Unfortunately, despite the amazing and tentative service the actual dishes were uninspiring and unimpressive. The wine paring was awful, looking at some of...the wines of vino, our table discovered most of the pairings served to us came from the bottom 1%. Personally, this is one of the poorer performing Michelin restaurants I have been to. Although, I can say that the menu changes seasonally and it may have been by chance that there’s been a hiccup in February.More",2020-02-01,2,2.0,Friday,February

8,World Class Restaurant,Jonathan S,9,2020-02-07,"We arrived about ten minutes late for our reservation and received a very warm welcome and seated right away. The space is modern, well arranged and modern music played at a comfortable level in the background. Most of the team spoke perfect English and did...a wonderful job explaining each dish and the wine paired with it.  Every course was delicious, well presented and well portioned. My wife and I have tried to eat venison dozens of times, without success,and here we had sugar cured, venison tartare and it melted in our mouths. This was our best meal in Paris and well worth the price.More",2020-02-01,1,5.0,Friday,February
