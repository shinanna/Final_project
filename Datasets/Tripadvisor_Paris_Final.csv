You enter and then feel enveloped and embraced by the warm intimate ambience and understated decor which means no distractions and the need for the food to speak for itself and it sure did.
Before touching on the food here we have a limited number of tables well spaced and in these covid times you feel much safer than the overcrowded noisy brasseries with tables on top of each other
The chef obviously has a good pedigree as his biography speaks for itself and the food more than matches this with a degree of modesty on this part
The restaurant is only open five days a week for lunch and dinner and due to limited seating you need to book in advance and that can be done one month ahead so do not be disappointed.
The menu was a surprise five course degustation excluding amusebouche cleanser predessert and petit fours so all in all incredibly generous at €75 a head
The service was seamless and all of the dishes had originality creativity delicacy and flavour as images speak for themselves.It was clever to have cleanser lime sorbet between fish and venison main dishes as well as a predessert which in its own right could have equally been a dessert proper
Cannot recommend this place enough - such a small establishment allows for excellent service which it was.Notably the chef visited our table at the end. of our meal and asked for feedback
This will be number one on our list next time we come to Paris - it really does deserve a Michelin star although not always welcomed by some chefs as a noose around your neck

We visited OKA as we would like to explore something different during our stay in Paris. The place was small and cozy at a peaceful neighborhood with a great advantage of having direct eye contact with the cuisine.

The wine
The wine list was good although not as rich as expected for a Michelin starred restaurant. Also the prices were 3x compared to the prices sought at a wine shop which is considered as expensive. We ended up with the wine pairing choice to accompany our diversified menu at the cost of €60 per person. The selection overall was good with the highlight the dry porto served at the end.

The menu
The restaurant offered only the option for its “blind” heritage menu which consisted of 4 dishes plus two desserts at the price of €85 per person. The restaurant prepares its own butter from cachaca which was very interesting. The main attraction was a dish with salsify and a creamy sauce. The other two scallop dishes were nice. The beef and beans from Amazon dish could become better (the beans should have been boiled a little bit more and with more salt as well as for beef one might expect picanha in a Brazilian restaurant for more intense flavor). Desserts were also good. In summary, all dishes in the menu had a consistency like all tracks in a movie soundtrack.

The staff
The staff was very professional and friendly, always willing to add value in the experience.

The value
For all the above plus two glasses of champagne (at the cost of €44 in total) we paid €344. The price was normal for this type of restaurant except the €44 for two glasses of champagne which is ridiculously expensive.

The conclusion
The restaurant has good standards. The menu is interesting as it combines french cuisine with Brazilian ingredients and the staff was very friendly. As such the place worths a try.","Reviewed January 5, 2020 ",Date of visit: January 2020,,,

This is probably the most important fine dining restaurant to visit right now. The chef and his team deliver a simply flawless performance. This begins before you even arrive to the restaurant with a phone call from one of the restaurant's managers to check on preferences, special occasion etc. Basically 5 minutes to ensure the highest level of personalization. Of course there are very few places that offer Ledoyen's sense of arrival and such a beautiful historic room. And then you sit down. First comes the amazing grower champagne and gone are the canapes. Instead come two amazing amuse bouche prepared table side. Once of them fancy: caviar, cream etc and the other as simple as can be: a little bread, a little sauce to be eaten with your fingers. Wow!

And then comes a succession of dishes, one more amazing than the other. Like watching a ballet between the kitchen and servers. Unbelievable. The hardest part was deciding which main course to select...so we selected 3 for the two of us and each was simply outstanding.

Highlights for us were the white truffle and egg,, langoustine, turbot on this gorgeous bed of garlic and veal sweetbreads.

Both chefs (Yannick and Martino) visited the tables multiple times which is awesome and unusual. These are real chefs who work in their kitchens every day and it's refreshing to see.

All in all, i really tried hard to find a single fault...but i could not.

Starting from the service: most of the staff inexperienced and not speaking English. Ordered the tasting menu with wine paring and the waiters were not able to explain dishes and wines in English. There was no sommelier in sight and the menu was brought to us in a rush.
The items in the menu were nothing particular. The best dish was the spelt, the langostine ravioli with the bisque were ok but all the rest was just a joke. The scallops were tasteless, the fois gras had no flavour and even if they asked how we wanted the duck to be cooked (if medium rare or rare or well done), in the end they brought to the whole table the same piece of meat cooked in the same way - and we gave completely different answers.

Called back to say we would be a little late and was told that was not a problem. What they don’t tell you is that to see anything of the Eiffel Tower you have to sit outside and they wanted us to sit inside but I asked if we could sit outside - it was lateish but we were still in good time - seems in France everything closes at 9.30pm - the waiter in charge was clearly not pleased by my request - but a nice young woman spoke to him in French and reluctantly he agreed. He then told us to stand on the side in the street while he served several other tables their main courses, got some people to pay their bills and after 25 minutes made up the tiniest table for 2 that took precisely 30 seconds to do!

He then told us we could sit and disappeared - at which stage having stood around for 25 mins I realised that actually on 9th October it’s cold in the streets of Paris at 9.30pm - furthermore we were sitting on little metal camp chairs - so after not being asked if we wanted a menu forget about being asked what we wanted to eat we we got up and disappeared ourselves.

So I can not critique the food as I never got close to it but the waiter was awful and there seemed to be only 3 of them so at least 33.33% of the service is awful!

We walked around for a little and came across a restaurant called Cafe De L’Esplenade. Well they had a very nice hostess who sat us down on the terrace with so many heaters it’s truly tropical. The dining chairs had very nice comfortable cushions on them and the waiter that took our order was excellent and so pleasant - the food was outstanding and the drinks delicious.

So we had a very good evening but 20 Eiffel restaurant needs to wake up and smell the coffee if they want to remain relevant in this post COVID environment - it won’t take the long for people to work out that there are 1 million friendlier places to eat in Paris.","Reviewed October 11, 2021 ",Date of visit: October 2021,,,

This meal was the centerpiece of our visit and one designed to celebrate our trip to Paris as well as a birthday and an anniversary. The restaurant is charming and warm, a great space to sit with loved ones to dine. However, that's about as good as our experience got. When we arrived, no one took our coats--it wasn't until other guests arrived and the seating got crowded did someone came to take them. The sommelier gave excellent champagne and wine recommendations. We ordered a total of three bottles and once the initial pour was made, we had to ask to get our glasses refilled, but spent a great deal of the meal sitting with empty glasses. The food came in fits and starts with little interest or enthusiasm from the servers and other than the monkfish, it was mostly bland and uninteresting, particularly the hunting venison, which was a tasteless piece of meat swimming in an overwrought barbeque sauce. We all agreed the peanut butter dessert was quite delicious--but wait--before we had even finished eating it, our bill was slapped on the table! Time to go! Our first time ever in France having a bill delivered to us before we had even finished eating!

Frenchie has been and still could be a great restaurant. But what makes a great restaurant? Is it just good food? Is it good service? Is it thoughtful wine selections? Is it great service? Is it special touches? In a city like Paris, where culinary magic is happening all over the place and for prices much lower than a place like Frenchie, my recommendation is to not waste your time. Go for something that is less concerned with popularity and celebrity and is still striving to give you great food and an amazing dining experience.","Reviewed December 17, 2021 ",Date of visit: December 2021,,,

We did the discovery menu, as we’re about to fly to Crete for 10 days and wanted to manage the cost. It was also a very delayed anniversary celebration, so we balanced cost and optimal experience on this occasion. La Dame delivered.

The canapés we’re beautiful, the amuse bouche divine. We also enjoyed an aperitif, “Collette”, which was one of six options, each creatively based on famous and influential, French women. We were not disappointed and at this stage, excited.

Water was left empty and asked several times to no avail.

Food was not good. The menu changes everyday so perhaps we came on an off night but the textures and flavors were too salty, too sour, too dry…it’s hard to mess up braised beef but they managed to.

Although 43 euros is not a lot of money so I am aware that expectations cannot be too high, I think basic customer service or answering questions and also food that tastes decent is a basic requirement of that price point. Both of which Pierre sang failed.

Is this an ""The emperor's new clothes"" effect?

My lack of praise is based on several things - smaller and bigger. And the price/performance is certainly a factor weighing in.

For a one star the prices for a la carte is mostly fair; however the starters are a bit high (from 37 and up). The main dishes ok in price with two exceptions: the turbot and the ris de veau topping 72 and 58 EUR. That's a lot of money for a dish and suggests ""great expectations"" in a price region where one usually find two star establishments.

The staff is kind, eager and young. And lecturing a learned rhyme, but their responses are non existent or disconcerted for ""unprepared"" questions - there gives no space to more intricate queries like the origin of the ingredients etc.
So, a bit unexperienced while they try to sound very experienced...

As dinner time peaks the eagerness of the staff turns into stress. They run around and the relaxed and somewhat dignified feeling you expect at an establishment of this kind is totally missing. They appear by the table for taking away plates which is not finished (main blunder) but are unattentive to fill up the glasses with the wine bottle that you're not permitted to have at your table.
If the wine is not set AT the table, very much attention must be payed for refilling. Else, you should not have this type of order.

Furthermore, we had a rather expensive bottle of white and the sommelier put it aside without a cooler! There it stood for twenty minutes and I had to ask him to fetch a cooler. It appeared ten minutes later (when the bottle was half full).
Nah... with a Michelin star on the front door this is quite appalling!

Now then, the food:
We chose from the carte and we chose the above mentioned high priced main dishes - just to challenge our really high expectations.

As starters we tried the fried fois gras and the crab dish (torteau).
The fois gras was fine, but not exceptional.

The crab was spectacularly presented and had interesting fireish flavour combinations, but actually the crab (or the lobster jelly, or both) ""tasted fish"" (in the lesser good sense), which it really should not do.

The 72 EUR turbot: good, but nothing exceptional justifying the price. The ""nage iodée"" was very hard to identify along with all the other ingredients.

The 58 EUR ris de veau: not good enough. Too many flavours competing on attention, A lot of sauces and paste of various kinds took the attention away from each other. Lack of firmer textures made the whole dish a more or less mushy experience.

This was also eminent in the mysterious ""amuse"" presented at the beginning of the meal. The list of ingredients read by the waiter was so long that not even a third could be remembered.
It turned out to be a chaos of tastes and mushiness.

It seems that the kitchen really doesn't know what the aim is. There is no concentration or clearness in what type of flavour they are searching for.
Obviously there is no trust in that the fine main ingredients can speak for themselves. Or at least with a carefully chosen selection of accompanying accessories...

After all this we had totally lost interest in having a dessert, so we bid farewell.

Le Sergent do have ambition, do use fine ingredients and do have obvious skill in the kitchen. But the setbacks mentioned above in combination with the occasionally upscaled pricing cannot lead to a top ranking from my point of view.

""Much ado about nothing"" is unfair to say. But ""much ado about very little"" is unfortunately true...","Reviewed January 2, 2022 ",Date of visit: December 2021,,,

One of the dishes we ordered was the duck (for 2). A dish we were told the chef would be carving it himself at carving station.

I think we shared everything (escargot, cassoulet, and a Napolean). It was all delicious. It's not too fussy. The wines by the glass are all delicious and reasonably priced.

The only dish that was good was the lobster risotto, which is a main dish. Unfortunately, our plates contained only about 5-6 spoonfuls. We’ve been to France before; we appreciate and understand European portion sizes. This was different and to that point, we sat beside an American B-list celebrity and his wife.

I cannot fully express my disdain for a place that does not treat all its paying guests equally.

We asked Francoise at Hotel Champ de Mars for a dinner recommendation and she suggested Bistrot Belhara -- a small restaurant only a couple blocks from our hotel in the Rue Cler area.

The restaurant was not crowded because the Covid pandemic was still with us. They checked our vaccine cards. We ate at 7pm and only one other group was dining there at the time.

It was perhaps the best meal I’ve ever had in Paris, and I’ve visited over a dozen times. I was concerned that I’d be bombarded with questions because I was the only French speaker in our group of five Americans.

The waiter couldn’t have handled it better. He suggested we have a “surprise” dinner, where he would make all the decisions. All we had to do was pick the number of courses.

It’s been several months since our visit, so I don’t remember everything we ate. But the main dish was some kind of beef which had been simmering many hours. It was sooo delicious and tender! And there was an amazing celery soup that was presented beautifully. Everyone in our group agreed it was the best meal of our trip.

Three friends and I had a particularly lovely and leisurely lunch. Everything was prepared with care and accompanied by efficient, friendly, and attentive service.

La Rotisserie’s oeuf mayo are award winning and it's easy to see why. Sublime in taste with an eye-catching presentation, these are a modern take on a revered French culinary classic. For the main course, a large, beautifully seared and succulent pork chop (a special) commanded my attention, while my friends found enjoyment in their sea bream (another special), duck breast, and a silky pumpkin veloute. For dessert, I luxuriated over pecan crème surrounding a luscious caramel center, all nestled between two clouds of choux (this was from the adjacent Boulangerie de la Tour). My friend’s house dessert was a stunningly smooth crème brulee.

With its window side tables and a Left Bank location along the Seine (ideal for a post-lunch or dinner stroll), dining at La Rotisserie D’Argent is one of the pleasures of being in Paris.

Many times in one-star restaurants my wife will feel as if her vegetarian menu is simply an afterthought but here she was impressed with each course. Myself, I had no specific expectations for the style of cooking from this restaurant and I was honestly blown away. The mushroom dish and the deer were some of the best dishes I've had at any restaurant ever. The wine was also excellent and well balanced with the food.

Lastly, as prices of Michelin-starred restaurants in Paris trend significantly upwards (presumably thanks to COVID and the global logistics problems), the price for a full tasting menu including a small cheese plate was quite reasonable.

Then came a stew of veal with mushrooms like a most modern and refined version of the traditional ‘blanquette de veau”. The depth and umami of the sauce was …incredible.
And then a dessert of delicate buttery puff pastry with layers of poached pears and chocolate sauce with a garnish of raspberry sauce around.

The waiter was rude when I asked for a non-alcoholic drink. The scallop appetizer was lukewarm and lacked flavor. I had a much better scallop dish at Le Grand Controle at lunch today. My cousin had the baby lamb which like another reviewer stated was also fatty (and undercooked) for her. The Bresse chicken has no flavor (and is also undercooked). They serve a few meager slices of a whole chicken (and probably eat the rest in the back themselves, if they can stomach it themselves). The dessert was probably the best part.

Most of the tables are empty, but they insist on sitting us in by the congested & chilly entrance, rather than empty tables by the window. The buffet was filled with a delicious & wide array of starters.

We all order the beef bourguignon, only to be informed that they only have 1 dish left so we had to choose between pork or liver. The 3 orders of pork were gamey, tough, fatty, and not worthy of the restaurants reputation. The one beef dish was small, but delicious. Disappointed & surprised that they ran out of a main entre when we were the 2nd table at brunch.

The desert selection, including chocolate mousse, crepes, tarts, & cookies was the best. The meal was complimented by rich red wine and cheeses. The setting was very pretty and all the servers spoke English, but their customer service could be better. Overall, glad we dinned there prior to the opera, although the pork entrees were disappointing and we didn’t understand why they ‘reserved’ the better tables for parties the same size as ours (4 adults) who arrived later.","Reviewed December 19, 2021 ",Date of visit: December 2021,,,

There was a slight mix up with my wife’s order but the mistake was resolved quickly and with style. However, the evening was soured by the sommelier who, without checking decided to serve me a glass of what seemed to be the most expensive red wine (Cherubin at €32/ glass). Whilst serving, he finished the bottle but the glass did not contain a full pour. Our waitress saved the day and another glass was added free of charge, but when we questioned the item at the end the sommelier was quite rude and made some inappropriate comments. For example, he offered us a glass of a digestive (Grand Marnier which is nice on Crepes Suzette but I think most would use a cooking ingredient, not drink a glass of after a meal) and asked my wife “if she would like to keep the bottle”. What went from being a lovely evening with great food turned into a disappointment that means we won’t return. We knew in advance that the evening would be expensive but it was a special event for us so that was fine, however for us to be poured a €32 glass of wine without “selling” the upgrade was unprofessional, the fact that it was under-poured was cheap, and the rude “jokes” at the end spoiled the evening",Reviewed yesterday ,Date of visit: February 2022,,,

- The staff seemed unequipped to address a request for one of our party to be served a pescatarian menu. After a few minutes, the only solution was to order the supplement in lieu of one of the dishes - for which we were charged a hefty extra fee.
- Menu was advertised as a “story” in chapters, but no story was offered or apparent. It was control without artistry.
- Perhaps most importantly, the food was mediocre at best. The chicken was overcooked, the Jerusalem artichoke undercooked and tough, the onion undercooked and chewy. We remarked on this a couple of times and no effort was made to explain or correct course. Most courses had 2-3 separate small plates each, none of which really held together.
- The staff was overwhelmed — dishes piled up on our table and were only cleared moments before the next course arrived, or - on one occasion - only cleared when we finally asked for them to be cleared, after having waited for 15+ minutes.
- The same wine glasses were used for red and white wine.

A few things that I thought were positive:
- Atmosphere was pleasant — open kitchen and warm colors were nice.
- Desserts were stronger than the rest of the courses: the ice creams pre-dessert as well as the truffle / prune / marshmallow post-dessert were really nice. The main pear-focused dessert had some nice parts (like the mascarpone oreo which was delicious), but overall was underwhelming.
- Lots of gutsy decisions (onion in brioche, pear dessert), but I can’t say we were rewarded for those decisions.

We have been to several dozen Michelin starred restaurants across a number of cities. This ranks among our two most disappointing experiences. Given the other reviews, all I can think of is that something went wrong in the kitchen and they were short staffed in the house.

A 5-course menu, in order from less to more, with a spectacular closing with an outstanding Duck, yes! However, it is not something that has generated such a great memory that says...we must return. The value for money does not match what I thought a Michelin should be.
The elegant and nicely presented dishes are generous in their portions.
Service details that can make such a night memorable should be taken into account. No knives for the fish, one dish was even chipped.
The chef is in charge of having long conversations with the potential high tickets about his wine list, which must be superb, I was unable to see it, nor he never offered me, guess is his business and he must know it. The other diner guests must be satisfied with watching the waiters pass by, who with great quality make an effort to explain the dishes.
The bread was outstanding, but it would be nice to serve it with butter?
So if you are going to try a restaurant in Paris, where Michelin expectations are what you aim for, be sure to study the options, of which there are thousands in Paris, so that you are not left with only one spectacular and memorable one plate out of five.

But when I provide feedback in the restaurant and also after receiving a standard ""how was your meal"" email and both are ignored, Tripadvisor is the place to go.

First off, we didn't like the food. Yes, its very subjective, but it was too played with, too many flavours on the plate - and many did not work together.

There was a 'story' for each and every dish - and some of the stories were so long (and boring!) that the food was cold by the time we could eat it. For the final course, my partner's fish was stone cold. But sinfully for a restaurant in France, my duck was 'bien cuit"" - well done. Of course, it should have been bleu - confirmed by the waiter well after the meal, but no apology offered... sad.

Secondly the wine & wine paring. First I said I was a fan of Israeli wines and asked if there are any Israeli wines on the menu - and they said they had one, but it wasn't on the menu. No attempt to offer this to me... strange. Thus we opted for the €75 wine paring which was a combo of wines around the world - Australian, Argentinian, Chilean + a Sake. All fairly basic stuff - nothing special at all, which made the paring overpriced for what it was.

Thirdly the service. The restaurant is counter only, which is fine, but when you are served from the front, as well as people delivering and describing things from both your back left and right, it is most uncomfortable and awkward.

With every customer speaking English (that night at least), I certainly felt it was a restaurant designed for tourists. And the food proved it.

I hope this is helpful to anyone considering this restaurant, as its hard to get a table.",Reviewed 4 weeks ago ,Date of visit: December 2021,,,

2. Poked my arm with the dessert menu as I wasn't looking his was as I was talking with someone at the table
3. Asked what we wanted for dessert whilst looking around the room (too busy for us)

We have eaten at le Vitis, and been refused service for lack of a reservation at le Vitis, more than once. The most recent occasion was another excellent meal in a convivial atmosphere with a warm bistro setting. The restaurant is small, so the sudden arrival of several people will fill it to capacity. (With proper arrangements in advance, a table d'hote is available in the sous sol that can accommodate 16 or so for a private party.)

The brothers (cousins?) in charge and the cook are experimenting with small plates, in addition to the traditional entree-plat-dessert. Small plates offer more tasting experiences for a single meal. So we had a cauliflower soup, razor clams, tuna mousse, grilled hure, creme brulee, mousse pralin, a 50cl of good Viognier, left a tip, and spent less than 80e. A light lunch is under 20e per person. If you know a better meal for the money in the general vicinity, please let me know where to look.

Hure is a dish new to me but ancient in Gaul. Dictionary research identifies ""hure"" as the hirsute, horrifying head of a boar, a bear, or your brother in law. Bits of meat and fat gleaned from the skull go into the mix for the terrine along with the spices known to the chef. Simply delicious.","Reviewed November 24, 2019 ",Date of visit: November 2019,,,

Ideally located at the foot of Montmartre, stepping into Mokko has the warm feel one might cherish after skiing in the Alps. The kitchen is front and center in this tiny restaurant. The dining room has a bright glow with wine bottles decorating the walls and delighted chatter from diners illuminating the atmosphere.

The menu is written on a chalkboard, which the waiter carries around, and it's as simple as can be, with a couple appetizers, entrees, and desserts each. Still can't decide? No problem; the chef offers his own suggested combination, which amounted to 4 courses for a measly 40 euros or so. My girlfriend, a vegetarian (and non-Francophone) who wasn't sure about her options had her own unique courses crafted with seeming excitement from the staff. And the dishes were absolutely fantastic. All were very simply, with a fairly short list of ingredients apparent. But they were as good as anything either of us had ever eaten.

If you went to Mokko as a 3 Michelin star restaurant, charging 150 euros per person, you would not be the slightest bit disappointed in your experience here.

The menu is not large, which to me is a good sign that they take care with what they make. I confess that my neighbor's beef and mashed potatoes looked delicious but I couldn't order such an American-seeming dish in a French restaurant. The other neighbor had a scallop dish that cost a bit extra on the menu, looked wonderful, and was probably worth the few Euros extra.

The standard sidedish is venere (black) rice, which is also very good, but you are very much encouraged to take others, like baked carrots or fennel gratin, but nobody ever tells you that each extra sidedish is 12€ which is quite a steal.

Also, you can skip desserts. I'm ok with the idea of paying 20€ for a dessert, but it has to be something extraordinary, original and freshly prepared. Not the usual millefeuille, baba au rhum or apple pie, that has been waiting on a tray since the morning.

They urge you to order the tasting menu. Wildly expensive (300€) (as are the a la carte options). It is fabulous. Seemingly, it will continue until you ask them to stop. Wine pairings offered (and changed) by the glass. Heavy use of luxury ingredients: langoustines, prawns, caviar. Small portions, but many of them. Delicately sliced raw squid with caviar, vegetables, sweetbreads, raw sardines, steamed langoustine.

The food was inventive, uncomplicated, prepared in front of you and served by cooks and waiters all of whom seemed to be having great fun.

Chef Aida is a creative genius that strives for perfection and you can see it always in the way he prepares food. If you watch the way he cuts and moves you can see a master in front of you. The food itself is simplicity at it's finest in the japanese way. I read some complaints here but I believe this is because those people do not understand what this type of food is all about. If you're looking for pretty plates and typical rich french food then this is not the place for you. If what you seek is simple perfection where the ingredients do the talking and the preparation and texture provides the soul then this is the place for you. One piece of advice, always go with the higher priced menu, it makes the world of difference and I believe Chef Aida uses this difference to weed out customers or customers that he does not want back. Only 9 servings per day, you can bet those seats are in high demand and each time I go I usually run across the same people.

All of us who research restos on this and other sites and then dine at the chosen few well know; a pretty dish does not make a good or great dish. On this there was no discordance. Aromas, flavors, textures were all true, honest, pure, deep, and transparent. Really putting to shame a score of Michelin places we have dined in where quality products are so commonly confusingly juxtaposed and/or so manipulated they lose their primary characteristics. I know going to Paris the foodie wants to find the next Septime as we did many years ago but if you are in the neighborhood and want good direct honest complicated enough but not thankfully not overly so consider this restaurant.
