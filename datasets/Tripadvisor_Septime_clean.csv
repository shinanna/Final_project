great for vegetarians,Turner S,762,2021-08-14,"Have been lucky enough to enjoy their food a few times now and I recommend for vegetarians looking for a quality Michelin experience.  Not all dishes were vegetarian, but they can easily adjust the menu if you ask.  They are very accommodating of allergies and...preferences. They made broccoli smell like steak and taste better than broccoli ever has before for me.  At the end of the day, I prefer my meat, but for those who don’t I think you will enjoy Septime.  The wine pairings leaned too heavily of natural wines for my liking, but I did enjoy the orange wines.  Both seem to be trending in Paris in 2021.More",2021-07-01,0,4,Saturday,August
Spend your money somewhere else.,758shelinas,24,2021-08-06,"We have visited Septime last Tuesday after waiting for a long time. We had this restaurant on our list for forever. We went for a tasting menu with a bottle of wine. We went on a big food trip visiting Ogata, PavYllon, Septime and restaurant...A.T. After having seen the wine list we ordered a bottle of white whereas the waitress came with a bottle of red. No problem, changed in it time. Then the 7 course meal started and that is where it went wrong. The speed of service (starting at 21.20) was way too fast and noticing the hovering service over our empty (or not) plates was beyond polite. As service was already that bad (did not refill our wine glasses once as they are so focused on the empty plates). The food is so-so, when talking about bistro, if we talk about Michelin starred restaurants we aren’t even close to the expectation nor quality of food. We left at 23.00 after finishing the meal at 22.45. We mentioned the fact of speed of service and lack of service. the restaurant manager started to disagree as she told us that this is what the chef wants. Let me be clear about one thing: speed of service is for the host(ess) and not for the chef. We will never come back, what an awful experience with a bill of at least €200.- (just food). This is not a Michelin starred restaurant. Don’t visit. Go to Bouillon Chartier if you want to eat fast. Service is superb there.More",2021-08-01,2,1,Friday,August
Spectacular - our high expectations were met,bluesky2020a,82,2020-07-27,"We got a reservation at Septime a couple of months after Covid lockdown, after having had in the past not much luck at getting a reservation. We had pretty high expectations, because this place is extremely hyped, but we were very pleasantly surprised that those...expectations were met. The food was spectacular and hands down the best we've had in France in our year here. Highlights were creamed artichoke with blanched almonds, truffle and sumac, an aubergine dish with mushroom jus and cuttlefish, a vegetarian cabbage main with flowers and preserved peppers, and a verbena flower ice cream with honey. An excellent fancy option in France if you are vegetarian. Yum!More",2020-07-01,1,5,Monday,July
Groumet as I'm used to,Sinyanchway,4,2020-03-10,"We were invited here by our business parter and were surprised by the variety of the French kitchen. I knew that they're special, but this has been excellent. We had several dished of fish, sea food and meat. 
Nicely decorated and made on the point....From fish to meat, everything was like butter and easy to eat and enjoy.More",2020-02-01,3,5,Tuesday,March
"If you can get a table, you're in for the meal of a lifetime",Sophie F,31,2020-02-21,"Took me years to secure a reservation, but it did not disappoint, even with all the build-up. Very interesting dishes, using ingredients that are so simple into creating truly mind-opening food. Would recommend to anyone in a heartbeat. Could use better wines, some more meat...and we did not get butter (no one did on the night we were there), but apart from that, it is truly everything advertised and more.More",2020-02-01,2,5,Friday,February
Left disappointed by high expectation,Blaki_devi,87,2020-02-21,"After reading earlier reviews and articles on this restaurant, we came in expecting to be wowed by the flavours of the dishes. Unfortunately, despite the amazing and tentative service the actual dishes were uninspiring and unimpressive. The wine paring was awful, looking at some of...the wines of vino, our table discovered most of the pairings served to us came from the bottom 1%. Personally, this is one of the poorer performing Michelin restaurants I have been to. Although, I can say that the menu changes seasonally and it may have been by chance that there’s been a hiccup in February.More",2020-02-01,2,2,Friday,February
Unpretentious Michelin star restaurant!,Dr_Taniman,180,2020-02-11,"Totally unpretentious, with really friendly and professional staff. Simply industrial ambiance. The food is great and enjoyable. Very fair prices for a Michelin star place. Wine pairing has room for improvement. Overall... don’t miss this one!",2020-02-01,2,5,Tuesday,February
World Class Restaurant,Jonathan S,9,2020-02-07,"We arrived about ten minutes late for our reservation and received a very warm welcome and seated right away. The space is modern, well arranged and modern music played at a comfortable level in the background. Most of the team spoke perfect English and did...a wonderful job explaining each dish and the wine paired with it.  Every course was delicious, well presented and well portioned. My wife and I have tried to eat venison dozens of times, without success,and here we had sugar cured, venison tartare and it melted in our mouths. This was our best meal in Paris and well worth the price.More",2020-02-01,1,5,Friday,February
Fabulous,Tal G,12,2020-02-03,"Came for lunch with my 15-year old son. Loved the ambiance and decor, restaurant had a sunny and inviting vibe, worn wooden tables and plaster-peeling walls. Food was delicious and thoughtful, enjoyed everything we had.",2020-01-01,1,5,Monday,February
Amazing service almost outshines the food,towertobridgetours,0,2019-12-05,"The small blue building on a one way street is hard to find with no real sign and address, but try a little harder and the results are worth it. Each dish opens the palette to a world of adventure. We started with a small amuse bouche that warmed me from the cold Paris day. Followed by a series of indescribable plates all of which were as good as the last and makes you want more. The option cheese plate can be shared and though it’s not big after so many delights your high from the previous delights. The best part of the experience besides cardamom cream is the staff. They speak English so your not left to your own struggles. They make a point of exposing each dish in detail and compliment you on your wine choices!",2019-12-01,2,5,Thursday,December
A rare piece of art,aroundtheworld48hour,0,2019-12-02,"I am in Paris a fewtimes every year, and after having tried many times to get a reservation at ""Septime"" unsuccessfully, it finally worked out last week. Paris is a city blessed with quite a few excellent restaurants, so one must wonder how the incredible hype about this particular one is even possible,let alone for so many years. I was really sceptical, but did not try to create any special expectations, since I know this is how you get disappointed many times. Having the experience of dining at Septime now, I understand better why itis sohard toget a table there. First of all, it is quite a small place, with few tables.The atmoshphere is quite low key, but everything fits nicely into the picture, fromthe silverware to the flowers which seem to have been picked in the garden and then put into an old glass jar. The staff is casual and very friendly. The food is conceived of and prepared very meticulously and which much taste, but comes across effortlessly. This is where cooking and serving become art and not a business. Just like when I witness a perfect perfomarnce of a Shakespeare play or look at a Gerhard Richter painting, Septime managed to excite my senses and give me a truly extraordinary experience. Hence, I agree with the all the hype, which is not my usual reaction.",2019-12-01,1,5,Monday,December
Special dining experience,jsr19,0,2019-11-29,"We planned ahead and grabbed a reservation for one of our three nights in Paris, and I am so glad we did! Upon arriving we were welcomed and guided to our table in a nearly empty restaurant, within a short bit of time every table was full! We added the wine pairings to our meal, and with each course we were presented with something unique and delicious.The food was simply outstanding! Course after course we were wowed by the flavors and creativity of the dishes. The atmosphere of the restaurant is warm and comfortable. We had a wonderful experience at Septime from start to finish!",2019-10-01,0,5,Friday,November
Decent but not worth all the hype,hungryblackman,0,2019-11-14,"The wonderful owners of the hotel we’ve stayed in over the last few years were able to get my wife and I a reservation at Septime. It can be quite difficult getting a reservation here, so when the hotel staff were able to do so, they were excited, we were excited...but the excitement took a dip during the actual dinner experience.

Decor & Atmosphere - perfectly lit, nice layout and well regarded fixtures and fittings. The whole vibe is relaxed and friendly. From the outside this restaurants quite unassuming and nondescript, and you could almost miss it if you don’t ask around.

Staff - Very polite and friendly staff made us feel very welcome as soon as we walked in, right through to the end. They really are the stars of this establishment.

Food - Unfortunately the food here is quite forgettable. Yes they have a very interesting take on flavours; many contrasting and sense-altering flavour profiles, but apart from that, the food largely fell flat for both of us. The dishes just failed to come together most times and not much attention was given to the texture profile in my opinion. Tasting menu consisting of 7 dishes changes from time to time, so maybe we were just unlucky. A few highlights include the flat bread with roasted pumpkin seed paste; celeriac dish, scallops with pork, and mint ice cream with olive oil. The wine list is however quite extensive and the aperitifs were very interesting.

Will I come back soon? Maybe not, however the food is decent; just probably a bit overhyped.",2019-11-01,5,3,Thursday,November
Wonderful 65th birthday,Allen H,0,2019-11-14,The food and wine tasting was a fantastic experience. My daughters and myself celebrated my wife's 65th birthday this week. We had 32 glasses of paired wines for four people and the composite of all the different wines and/or liquors was perfectly complemented to the food experience. The food is very unique and different. I thought the price was very reasonable for the experience and service. Again I would highly recommend. Remember to make a reservation they open 21 days in advance.,2019-11-01,1,5,Thursday,November
Plan your reservation,johntmurray,0,2019-11-05,"This was my second visit; did lunch last November; dinner this time; people said impossible to book; difficult not impossible; just be aware of the time difference and book three weeks before you want to attend at the beginning of their work day in Paris; it may mean calling in the middle of your night; took me half hour to get through; well worth it; great food, wine and service; I liked the orange white from France; but everything is sensational.",2019-10-01,1,5,Tuesday,November
Fantastic Meal...Worth Getting Up in the Night to get a Reservation!,emandm21,0,2019-10-27,"To begin with, Septime's website doesn't totally explain how the reservation system works, which was a little confusing. You actually can only get lunch reservations online and must call the restaurant for dinner reservations. Their phones open at 10 am Paris time (3 weeks in advance of each date), which means I got up at 3 am where I live to make the reservation. I figured this out after missing my first attempt at a reservation.

That being said, it was definitely worth getting up in the night to make the reservation! My friend and I who dined there both consider ourselves pretty well versed in the food world and have eaten at our fair share of great restaurants. Septime definitely held up to the hype of being in the World's 50 Best. The vibe of the restaurant is warm and inviting, and you can get views of the action in the kitchen from a lot of the tables. The staff were all friendly, spoke English, and also tolerated my attempts at speaking French to them. The service was really spot-on throughout the meal.

For the food...The menu includes 7 courses as well as an amuse bouche. You can also add on a cheese course, which we did because...well, it's France. Standouts included: the scallops with miso, the Cacio E Pepe (which was made using ribbons of celery root instead of pasta...such an unexpected combination that tasted amazing), and the cabbage with lime and yogurt. The flavors of the cabbage were really interesting... it was totally unexpected that I would like cabbage so much! Really, all of the food was delicious. The only thing that would have been a nice add-on was a printed menu of what we ate at the end of the night like a lot of the higher end places do in the States. I have great memories and my photos...will have to rely on that!

For the drinks...my friend did the beverage pairing, which he liked. I decided I wasn't up for as much alcohol that night and decided against it. The staff were very accommodating and had no issues with one person doing the pairing and one not doing it. They gave great recommendations on wine when I was ready for it throughout the meal, and I had 3 great glasses. When we got our check at the end of the night, I was really pleasantly surprised that each glass was under 9 Euros...which would be unheard of at a high-end restaurant in the States!

Overall, this was a fantastic meal and definitely ranks at the top of my personal favorite meals. One other interesting note was that they change the menu every 3 weeks, so it is constantly evolving. The cost was extremely reasonable given the quality of the food and drink, the exceptional service, and the overall experience. I highly recommend a visit to Septime...it's worth the work at the reservation!!",2019-10-01,1,5,Sunday,October
Great Experience,collierje,0,2019-10-06,"I'll echo everyone else and agree that reservations are sort of a pain, especially since they have moved to #15 in the world. While I thought it was quite good, I'm not sure it is worthy of that lofty ranking. The service and space were top notch, and the wine pairing (except the dessert wine) were all spot on. The flavors were sort of uneven on some of the dishes, while others were great. If you miss out on reservations, you shouldn't kick yourself but I'd still recommend a visit.",2019-09-01,1,4,Sunday,October
Exceptional experience,Laura D,0,2019-09-22,"We went to Septime for lunch, and throughly enjoyed it. Although it is currently considered to be #15 in the world, it has a very warm and welcoming casual atmosphere (not at all pretentious). All the staff were very helpful and spoke excellent English. They explained each dish, including a short story about each of the matching wines. The food was spectacular - our favourite dishes were the tomato dish and the sweetbreads (we were away for 4 weeks in total and still talk about how fantastic all the dishes were). The flavours and fresh ingredients blew us away! There was also an option to add a cheese plate as part of the lunch before the dessert.",2019-08-01,2,5,Sunday,September

An excellent place if you can get a reservation,Juan Manuel V,0,2019-09-21,"We had the fortune of being able to get a reservation at this highly acclaimed and reviewed restaurant in Paris, France. Currently #15 in the world (whatever that means) in the Top 50 Restaurant list, and 1 Michelin Star, it is certainly one to look forward to, at least according to critics. Now, this is not your typical french restaurant with strict adherence to Michelin guide guidelines, it’s a little bit more loose and informal and feels way better than others that I’ve visited. Staff was very welcoming, friendly and overall jovial, which kind of surprised me. The place has a very modern decoration, very hip if you ask me; I liked it a lot, and the food of course, which is the most important thing, is mostly really good and it tries to do something different, which in most of these places does not seem to be the case.

There were a couple of exceptional courses, specifically the one with caviar and the tomato steak. They really stood out from the rest. As the name implies, Septime offers seven course meals (without counting the vegetable tray as an appetizer and the wonderful bread that keeps coming and coming). I would love to describe all the dishes but menu’s were in French and even though the staff went out of their way to explain everything in English and Spanish, I really don’t remember everything. I’ll let the pictures do the talking.

If you have a chance to go to Septime, please do, it’s definitely worth it and is one of the up and coming restaurants, that should crack the Top 10 soon.",2019-09-01,1,5,Saturday,September
Inadequate prenotation system ,664guiag,0,2019-09-05,"I have been very careful about booking deadline but their site didn't work and the bistro was not reachable by phone for all August. They kept us in waiting list (with credit card provided and 190€ fee in case of no-show) till the day before the dinner, with no success. ",2019-09-01,2,1,Thursday,September
Superlative,KarenAustin,0,2019-08-10,"We went for lunch. At the advice of the couple finishing their meal at the table beside us, we did the wine pairing with the multi-course meal. What an excellent suggestion— one we pass on here. I can’t say enough good things: excellent, imaginative food; perfect wine with each course; all explained beautifully by the superb staff. I will put this on my fo-to list anytime I’m in Paris— even if there are so many other excellent places to try in Paris! It was simply a memorable eating experience.",2019-06-01,4,5,Saturday,August
"A super chill fine dining experience, BUT the restaurant has NO AIR CONDITIONING!!!",maodohsiao,0,2019-08-01,"We went the day before France had the record breaking temperature of 42.7C (109F). When we started our meal at 7.30PM, it was 39C (102F), and when we ended our meal at 10, it was 37C (98.6F). It was SO unbelievably hot that it took away from the dinning experience to a certain extend.

With that said, it was still one of the best meals ever. I love that it's a Michelin star restaurant for fine dinning, at the same time, the environment was relaxing (not stuffy). The team there was extremely friend, young, and energetic.

Def a place I would love to go back one day - just not ever in the summer again!",2019-07-01,1,4,Thursday,August
A down to earth world class experience!,Allison T,0,2019-06-30,As great luck would have it my friend was able to score a very tough-to-get reservation!

A Great Place,Verneuil13,0,2019-06-24,"After trying several times to get a table, a friend visiting Paris kindly got one and invited me. I do understand their success.Everything was perfect. The set menu is simply marvelous, light and with the right portions.An incredible flavor's evolution with a sans faute. Service was relaxed but highly professional.

I will always remember Septime!,holland23,0,2019-06-07,"Possibly my favorite dining experience ever. I made sure to get up exactly at 4am, exactly 21 days before the day we were to dine to set my reservation and it was so worth it. The staff was extremely friendly and approachable. The restaurant space was cool, well decorated with an open kitchen that was busy and well coordinated. Each dish that came out was visually stunning, delicate, delicious, and a different experience. It was cool for us not quite knowing what was to follow as they use a carte blanche menu and we just kept getting surprised. They handled my seafood allergy with great care and were attentive to all of our needs. This is easily one of the best restaurants in the world and HUGE bonus from us on the fact that Septime is a very sustainable and environmentally friendly establishment. Try and get reservations and go, you will love it.",2019-05-01,3,5,Friday,June
"six plates, two great and four blahhh",Bonimba55,0,2019-06-04,"I was really disappointed, the place, the ambiance, the service and the wine was was very good but .... the rest was not worth it.
What can I say, the six plates were very inventive but beside the tuna tartare and the fish main plate (tiny piece) the rest was ... again blahhh",2019-05-01,0,2,Tuesday,June
Relaxed yet refined dining,RJLev,0,2019-05-29,"Having woken up at 4am 3 weeks prior to book the reservation, I was hopeful that Septime would not disappoint. To jump to the conclusion, it did not!

The food and service was spectacular, and the dishes that were brought were refined and elevated tastes in items that I didn’t know were possible. The vegetable focus was elegant and more than satisfying.

The wine pairings were unusual and spot on.

As someone from abroad, we were made to feel welcome and wanted.

Would love to return. If in Paris be sure to try and experience this!",2019-05-01,0,5,Wednesday,May
Stunning Food and Service,MadamJosephine,0,2019-05-26,"It was a rocky start, we arrived early and were told in no uncertain manner to leave. The restaurant only opens at 7.30pm so don't arrive early or come before your booking time. We had an extremely charming young lady serve us, who recommended an excellent Chardonnay which went well with all our dishes. As stated in other reviews there is no menu, dietary issues are catered for, but you have no choice as to what is brought to your table. We enjoyed every single dish and after 2 bottles of said Chardonnay the bill for 2 was 400 Euros before the tip. It's a very casual looking place, the atmosphere is buzzy and the food & floor staff were top notch on the night we visited.",2019-05-01,0,5,Sunday,May
Worth the hype? YES!,heatherlyrock,0,2019-05-23,"We were worried that Septime would be overhyped because it made all the lists. But we were surprised that the hype was well deserved. We had a great lunch experience and enjoyed all the dishes. They were skillfully executed. The common zucchini and the unusual acacia flowers were quite delicate with light butter sauce. The chicken was perfectly cooked with crispy skin and super tender meat. It was delicious with the whole grained mustard and sabayon smoked potatoes (super tasty). The tuna was perfectly paired with the unexpected beets. The accompanied asparagus was cooked just right. All vegetables were tender with a soft crunch. To top it off, it’s the best deal in town. Highly recommended if you can get a reservation!!",2019-05-01,0,5,Thursday,May
I really wanted to LOVE this restaurant...,deniseVancouver,0,2019-05-18,"I was very excited that I got a lunch reservation after trying hard to get a dinner reservation. Cute interior. Acoustics were pretty loud and tables were very close together. It appeared that the majority of the guests were tourists. I actually didn't hear any guests speaking anything but English. After reading all the rave reviews, this was the one restaurant that I was hoping to love a bit more than I actually did. Service was good, however, our server didn't put much effort in to telling us what we were being served. The table next to us had a much better server and we easedropped so we knew what we were going to be served as they were one course ahead of us. The food was good but it wasn't exceptional in my opinion, even maybe a bit bland. The price of the lunch tasting menu was good value and nicely plate presentation. One thing that was a negative to me was that they brought us a craft of sparkling water (not a sealed bottle) and when we finished it, they kept bring us refills without asking, when we got the bill, we were charged someting like $7 Euros per bottle which I found excessive. I don't think I would need to go back to this restaurant.",2019-05-01,4,4,Saturday,May
Had hoped for more,vacationsy,0,2019-05-11,"Septime is an upscale restaurant that is very proper. We showed up 10 minutes early and they asked that we leave the restaurant as it wasn’t open. So we took a walk around the block... in the cold damp weather.

No menu. You can pick a wine but the chef cooks you a six course meal that he chooses. We got four veggie to start which were very good. I remember the smoked potatoes were pretty unique. The fifth was a small fish dish. The dessert was pretty good which was a sorbet with crunchy topping. They also brought an extra dessert at the end. We were not full at the end of the meal, and I believe spent Euro 80 per person. It was a refined meal, but left us unsatisfied.",2019-05-01,2,4,Saturday,May

Highly recommend.",2019-04-01,0,5,Saturday,April
I expected more,ManilaGingersnap,0,2019-04-22,"Went on the waitlist when I realised this was close to Atelier Lumiere where we had tickets for the 2pm. I got a confirmation the day before and was so happy to try this Top 50 Best Restaurant.

The place is cozy, decor is very now, service is very efficient but I expected more from the food. As white asparagus is now in season, that's what they served s first course. It was light and refreshing. Second we had the cuttle fish in vegetable broth with a poached egg on top which was very much to my taste. For the mains, my two daughters and I had the cod and my husband the lamb. It was good not great. Dessert was the best part which was glacee with lime, dill, and almonds.

Paid 212 euros for 4 with a bottle of riesling. Took us two hours to finish and although we were very very full it felt like it could have been better.",2019-04-01,0,3,Monday,April
"Very good, but probably not worth the price",Cathy R,0,2019-04-07,"We did enjoy our dinner at Septime, but compared with some of the other restaurants in Paris, probably not worth the price tag. Our group of 3 was seated with a group of six at a large table. I expected that we would have our own table given that this was a Michelin star restaurant. However, even being seated with the other group, it was not too loud to have our own conversation. We had the wine pairings which were mostly good. The service was excellent. Dinner did last 3 hours.

Go now!,ryu0803,0,2019-02-15,We really enjoyed our dinner at this restaurant. Great atmosphere with friendly and welcoming staff. They served only one set menu plus an optional cheese course. The sommelier suggested nice wines and they also offered wine pairing. Food was refreshing and tasty except the two desserts which we found underwhelming. We were being seated in front of the open kitchen and it was entertaining to see the Chef and his team doing the show. The restaurant was ranked #40 on the 2018 World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. The 7 course dinner menu at €80 was amazing value. Go now before it gets expensive.,2019-02-01,0,4,Friday,February

Deliciously unpretentious,benmiller412,0,2019-01-06,"Oftentimes, French restaurants (especially in Paris), take themselves too seriously, offering fanciful food without much substance. Septime is all substance. Compared to 3-Michelin haute cuisine restaurants in Paris, Septime offers an unpretentious, refined take on French classics.

Very enjoyable,Monkeybat14,0,2018-10-25,"My first note will be that I can not fault this place at all - service was fantastic and the food very enjoyable.

1 Michelin star - ok seems very very fair indeed.

One of the world's best 50 restaurants - not so sure......... but I'll leave you to make your own mind up there.

Every dish was Excellent - modern cooking underpinned by classic French technique.

"Average, pretentious and disappointing ",nicolasc226,0,2018-10-13,"The ambiance is nice and relaxed and the staff is great.
The food is a surprise menu, visually well executed but far too complex and I would say pretentious.
Some of the dishes were ok, the sweetbreads were the worst I’ve eaten but the pudding was delicious. Wine list is good. Throw in a couple of bottles of wine between 5, a few beers, and you are in the zone of €120 a head...mind you, one does get 6 courses!
Honestly, I’m not sure what all the fuss is about. Paris has a lot better to offer

Very average,AmnaAlblooshi,0,2018-10-12,"Not worth the hype at all .. if you know good food and Michelin star worthy food don’t bother coming here if you are expecting and exceptional experience .. food was very average and mediocre .. we had the autumn menu .. the amuse bouche was ok .. the tuna and capers starter was 6/10 .. the caramelised leaks and peach dish was 8/10.. the main dish the pigeon was 6/10 the pigeon was very chewy they didn’t give us the right knives to cut its , I gave this dish and extra point for the cute presentation that looked like autumn leaves .. the dessert was the best I had there , figs with honey and peach sorbet .. this dessert is 10/10 very light very delicious but very simple not a Michelin star dish at all .. for a fine dining experience I give it 6/10 but since it’s a one Michelin I’ll give it 4/10 I really don’t get why this place is over hyped .. the atmosphere in the restaurant was so hot we practically were sweating when we sat there ..

Not worth the effort you go through to book a table ..",2018-10-01,1,3,Friday,October
Perplexed by lack of execution and bad wine pairing,Journey823987,0,2018-10-11,"Went to Septime as we had a friend who used to work here. Expected a good representation of seasonal ingredients and had heard great things about the wine list. Perhaps they had a bad service but the dishes weren't cohesive and showed average technique.

The wine pairing was primarily natural wine as expected but the wines were so thin they had no place accompanying food. The texture and seasoning of the duck was not great. The accompanying seared cucumber didn't work in texture or as a whole dish. The ice cream we had was watery and the fruits that accompanied looked like they had been frozen.

There was some good bites no doubt but tasting menu's should average out a couple great dishes a couple good dishes and a couple misses.

Should also note the service didn't ask about the quality of the food/wine in which case we would of said our two cents and probably left without finishing the tasting.

I do understand the nature of the industry and that variance exists but this review is more for the restaurant not for future visitors as I'm sure this isn't the standard the chef represents all the time.",2018-09-01,3,2,Thursday,October
Wow - How Delicious,Eatalyfood,0,2018-10-10,We were extremely lucky to get a reservation on a Friday evening in September during Fashion Week and the Ryder Cup!

One of the best places in Paris? This must be a joke...,jeanbworldtraveller,0,2018-09-24,"This restaurant's agenda is clear: Make high profit margins from unsuspecting customers.

I am not even sure where to start because everything was off...

Very tiny portions.
No coherence in flavors.
Bad quality ingredients.

Yes, it's cheap(ish) but it's easy to tell that it is. Other restaurants which are also cheap like restaurant H or Ken manage to do much, much better so this is no excuse.

The main dish was duck. I can by far say it was the worst duck I had in my life. It was SO chewy, I could have choked and died on it.

If you can't serve tender duck, then serve chicken. No one will blame you for it.

The only good dish was the polenta.

The wine pairing at 55 euro was NOT generous. The portions were so small it was almost insulting. Considering that they were serving 15 euro bottles, they could have done better.

Don't waste your time here. Go to another restaurant.

This chef needs to either go back to culinary school or worry less about his profit margins (or maybe increase prices so that he can offer better food).

We all left hungry.",2018-09-01,2,1,Monday,September

Amazing,E17fella,0,2018-08-03,Came here for dinner with two friends. We had the menu with the matched wines and it was an incredible dinner.

It was hands down one of the best eating experiences of my life. ,2018-08-01,0,5,Friday,August
Delicious but overpriced and still hungry after ,Patwak,0,2018-07-31,"Our friend lives around the corner and walked by to make a reservation 3 weeks in advance for us on a monday evening.

We received a warm welcome and then they showed us a very nice communal table with a nice view on the garden of the next door neighbors and with open windows for a refreshing breeze.

As the amuse we got breadsticks with cheese dip which were not fantastic. Quite boring actually.

This was followed by a great ( but small) raw tuna dish in a cold broth.

The 2nd course were oven roasted onions with dips.

The 3rd course was a vegetable course with white beans and greens with a delicious dressing.

The 4th course was a smoked duck with a side of pork belly infused mushrooms and nuts. Once again very good but very small.

Here is where the confusion started for us as before the meal started we received an explanation that it was a 6 course menu and then we received a scoop of ice cream with red fruit and a tiny bowl of ricotta with almonds.

We discussed this all day afterward and even called to ask about the 6th course. This was indeed the minuscule bowl of ricotta served together with the ice cream.

Verdict. The flavors were on point but the price-value ratio felt under-par. It feels like there was budgeted on the ingredients.

No need to wake up at 4am to make reservations.

Very disappointing. ,GuilhermeR902,0,2018-07-29,"It was really complicated booking a table at this highly rated contemporary French eatery. There is no online booking, you have to call at specific times. Due to a time difference, we had to wake up at 5 a.m. at a specific date to book a table. What a waste of time and sleep!

Septime has a pleasant decor and attentive staff, but the food is boring as hell! One failed attempt of creativity after another ... bland, uninteresting, muddy flavors came to mind at every bite. Don’t know how this place made the top 100 list! Don’t waste your time or money here, there are plenty of better choices in Paris with easier booking.",2018-07-01,1,2,Sunday,July

It is always a pleasure to dine in top restaurants in the world without dressing up. No pretensions just honest to goodness great food. The atmosphere is very casual but the food is not ordinary. I can still remember my first course “asparagus, first of the season”.... how can they make asparagus taste that way?

Lucky to get a table,Nebuliza,0,2018-07-04,"So what is clear from the reviews is that this is a tough table to get and there needs to be a lot of preparation in just getting in. Lucky for me I have a friend who has a number of connections in the industry and we were lucky enough to get a table on a Monday night. The Menu Carte Blanche and the paired wines is well worth the investment as the wines perfectly compliment the exquisite food. What I couldn’t get over was how elegant a lot of the food was. The tomato’s, in tomato water with mustard and tarragon in particular was so well put together for something looking apparently simple really blew my mind. The service was understated friendly and attentive. Fingers crossed you are able to get in. It is worth it. ",2018-07-01,0,5,Wednesday,July
Amazing experience,Hskimhk,0,2018-06-24,"Few days after coming here, we went to a 3 star Michelin restaurant - which was 3 times the price.

Great value proposition as well. Cant’ go wrong with this one. ",2018-06-01,0,5,Sunday,June
Impression and some tips for would-be diners,Elissa M,0,2018-06-21,"After trying for some time to get reservations in June 2018, findings very little info on line that was helpful, and had dinner there last night, I thought I would leave some breadcrumbs for the next person. Especially if that person is travellings to Paris from out of the country and has specific and limited dates to choose from. Or hady a kid, or specific tastes.

First, getting the reservation: you must call or go to the website for a reservation exactly 3 weeks/21 days in advance to secure a booking. They open the phones and the website bookings at 10am cest (1am pst) each day they are open. So if you are trying to get a reservation while not in France, set your alarm clock. It used to be that the website made reservations available at 12am cest (3pm pst) but that was not my experience in June 2018. Have some choices for times and dates that you are willing to accept in case you're first is not available, consider a lunch time as a fallback too. I had to wake up in the middle of the night to book a couple days in a row as my first attempt failed. I tried the phones first and it would ring and ring, get answered by a machine then hand up. Then after 20 minutes of failed phone calls I tried the website but no dinner seats were left at that point. Next night I tried the web site first but didn't see seats being made available at all so I began calling again. Non stop. For 30 minutes. At 10am my time. I finally got through! And they had dinner times available for us! So my recommendation is to try the web site and the phones and have second, third, forth choice days and times. Know enough French to understand the automated recordings if you get it.

To the question ""is it worth it, why does this need to be so difficult, why would you bother...?"" I say that the reservation system is part of the fun of the experience, I considered it a challenge. They have a tiny restaurant and can only hold so many people, have a Michelin star and an 80€ seven course menu. I'll make a few phone calls for that. Prefer that over 400€ meal at another highly sought after restaurant. So, yes, I found the reservation process not a problem and hopefully a contributing factor to fewer people making reservations!

Then what dinner is like: dinner was 80€ per person for a carte blanche menu. That means you get what they have that might. No menu items to choose from. You get 7 courses. They only adapt for allergies and vegetarianism. No substitutions. No kids menu. Wine pairing is 55€ more per person. The items served change every 2-3~ weeks depending on season, availability, freshness. We thought the food was pretty creative and good. I would not have selected the items we were served if given the choice (ex: sweetbreads, cold potato soup) but they were all pretty good and very creative. I would not say the flavors we're to die for but I'd return for the inventiveness of it. I did not think 80€ for a Michelin star and seven courses was bad. I left full. My 11 year old daughter even had an ok time of it. The only kids non-alcoholic beverage was an artisanal lemonade which she tolerated but it was no Panchos ;-). She liked the sweetbreads (we didn't tell her what it was) and the tuna dish and bread and salad but skipped a couple others like the child potato soup and braised lettuce with pine needles.

Note on kids: I'd feed any picky eaters some pb&j before dinner if you're worried. Or sneak in some goldfish crackers to appease them ;-) but please, to respect the other patrons, do not bring babies or really young ones that have the potential for a tantrum. Or whining. Your fellow guests will put a curse on your family with a plague if you ruin the meal they woke up at 1am to ensure. Seriously: no whiners! This is a small place and sound carries. Don't be that family.

Enjoy!!

"Very good, but maybe a bit overhyped...",ParisSooner,0,2018-06-15,"Don’t get me wrong, this is a very good restaurant. Top quality food, reasonable prices and great service. Everything was well prepared and we really enjoyed it. However based on all the hype, I expected it to be a bit more “special”. Perhaps it is just a victim of its own success and popularity, because my expectations were through the roof. All said, the service was excellent and the popularity did not seem to spoil the commitment of the team. The portions were perfect and the ambiance was laid back and enjoyable. I would certainly recommend - if you can get the reservation - but don’t feel like your trip to Paris was a failure just because you missed out on Septime.",2018-06-01,3,4,Friday,June
Fine food but few choices.,Marion T,0,2018-06-15,"We felt lucky to get a reservation, even for lunch, and were happy to find this bustling, pretty space waiting. The only problem was the limitation of the menu. There was a choice of main course--seared tuna or roast chicken. Appetizers and desert were 'surprises'. They waiter did ask if we had any food allergies, but I don't remember if he asked about things we did not like. The two appetizers were thin slices of raw octopus with bottarga cream and grilled asparagus. Unfortunately, one of us did not eat raw fish or asparagus, so the kitchen kindly provided a potato soup and grilled leeks as substitutes. All were delicious as was the chicken. The tuna, served with raspberries and grilled cucumbers, was less impressive. Dessert was an excellent Ile Flottante with lemon caramel cream. Really, the only critiscism I can make is the lack of choice. I'd had chicken the day before and did not really want that, but the tuna did not interest me. And I would have preferred a chocolate desert. But now we know--when we go, we take our chances. ",2018-06-01,2,4,Friday,June
"If you go in hungry, you'll leave the same way",matt m,0,2018-06-13,"In Paris for my father's 70th birthday and thought we'd try a restaurant purported to be one of the best in the world. The staff appeared to outnumber the clientele which was fine, if a little crowded, unlike the plates. The food was tasty and intriguing, just scarce.
We tried the set dejeuner with accompanying wines. I do not recommended this as, although I am far from a connoisseur, I can tell when a wine has hints of cider vinegar..
Not sure if they just had some bottles in the cellar that were on the turn..
On the whole an interesting experience, if only to witness what ""people in the know"" consider to be great food.

Underwhelming ,krolinka,0,2018-05-26,"We could not get the dinner reservation, so went in for lunch. Food was good, just good, nothing extraordinary. The wine pairing was not worth the price at all. The staff told us we would get full glasses of wine, but we got 4 tiny tastings instead - it was sake and Italian wines, very acidic, none of which I liked, so I definitely do not recommend.

Interesting Lunch Menu,PleasureofLifefbyMsS,0,2018-04-25,"It is not a restaurant that you can book a table a day or two before the day you want to eat there, but it totally is worthy of the efforts. I will try to get a table next time when I visit Paris.

The menu was set so I only had to decide for the main course to taste and what to drink. Although I'm not a big fan of Asian-French fusion as most restaurants fail to do it well, Septime does it subtly well, like petit pois and salmon roe is a combination that I never imagined. And cuttlefish with fresh almond and almond cream was fresh. Petit pois ice-cream was spot on too.

I didn't go for the wine pairing, but I saw some very interesting and international wine choices to go with the menu. The sparkling white from the Loire and the Italian dessert wine were memorable.

Service was good and friendly. I'm also grateful that the staff members who offered me help and handdled an unexpected situation very well.

Making a reservation can be tricky. I lunched at Septime alone, but there wasn't the option of one person on the online booking system. I booked a table for two and tried to email to confirm but got no response. So I ended up calling 2 days in advance during its calling time (stated on its website) to confirm. No problem at all as long as you call.
Also, for many popular restaurants in France, guests might be sent an email to ask to confirm their booking 24-48 hours in advance.",2018-04-01,0,5,Wednesday,April
Reservation fiasco,Chris47n,0,2018-04-24,"It’s hard enough to make a booking or get a response from this group if you don’t have a booking. I’ve been in Paris two months already and a few weeks ago was able to secure a lunch spot. When booking online I was not able to select one person, so when I received their confirmation I emailed immediately to say it would just be me. If not, and I missed my reservation they would charge me for two people. So, more than a week before my scheduled reservation I realized that the train strike would be happening the day of and once again immediately emailed asking if it was possible to change to the 25th since I am not sure what the train situation would be like. I received an email stating unfortunately they are fully booked on the 25th, but could put me on a waitlist if I wanted and give me a call. I emailed back to confirm that I wanted to be in the waitlist but still on the 24th. Come today, no email or call about the 25th so I left extra early on the train to make it to the restaurant and got to the area 2 hrs early. I wasted time and arrived at the restaurant at 12:45. I was told you do not have a reservation and asked if I got a confirmation. I showed my confirmation and the hostess said I was not in the system. She finally found me and said my reservation is for tomorrow. I explained to her that I had requested the change, but they had not called or emailed me to confirm. She said unfortunately they were fully booked and could not accommodate me. I was peeved. She said I could come back tomorrow, which I was not happy about and did not see why they could not accommodate 1. She asked if I wanted to go out side and talked and I asked “why, because it wouldn’t make a difference.” She stated that I was screaming , which was far from the truth. You would definitely know when I scream. I was very stern and direct. She then said that I could come back around 1:30 and they would ‘try’ and see if they could accommodate me. I stated so “that is not a confirmation,” meaning I would wait around for another 30 mins for a maybe, to which I said no thanks and to book me for tomorrow. I was planning on walking out of there with just her word and wanted a confirmation. She sent one and changed the time without asking me. I told her to change it to 1:00. I’m coming back tomorrow , but I’ll be honest the experience made me think twice about giving them my money. I will give an honest review about their food tomorrow, but they definitely need to improve on their reservation and response time to customers. ",2018-04-01,2,2,Tuesday,April
"Creative, Well-Executed Food",jclaybaldwin,0,2018-04-22,"Maybe I went in with lower expectations than the hype surrounding Septime (mostly due to the other reviews here), but I came away talking about some of the dishes here more than the other restaurants we ate at. Which I think says something. In particular, the spring peas in egg yolk, topped with seaweed and orange zest was surprisingly delicious. I've already recreated the roasted asparagus with cream and pistachios at home! Then the blood oranges in almond milk for a dessert was pleasant as well. The only real miss for me was the squab, which felt a little pedestrian—it resembled many I have had throughout the city. Only about 1/4 of the diners were America, which was surprising. Now, in terms of reservations—I called the restaurant exactly 3 weeks out about an hour before their service started for the day, and pretty much could choose anytime for two people. Now whether by the next day it was filled up, as many on here protest, I couldn't tell you. My advice would be if you get in, great! If not, you will find an equally exciting restaurant in Paris that is much easier to get into. The wines, by the way, were delicious. Interesting that the Somm poured the wines at her station, then brought the bottle and full glasses to you. Would definitely recommend",2018-04-01,0,4,Sunday,April

Ok, so if you are from any cosmopolitan city in the world with foodie scene, you will be underwhelmed. Yes, trust me you will.

My meal had homemade grissini, skinny breadsticks and an overly thick cheese dip, that was not very original. My starter was an oyster dish that was fresh. Clean and tasty in an understated way.

Sadly, My main of sole was over baked, hence rubbery, with a sauce so bland I can’t remember it. Cheese and dessert, likewise not worthy of recall.

Wine was fine and reasonably priced. Staff was fine,done a bit young and wet behind the ears, others professional and friendly.

"Cozy atmosphere,friendly service, good food",emilyv536,0,2018-04-08,"I had tried everyday to get a reservation at Septime during the 3 weeks leading up to our trip to Paris. We decided to see what would happen if we showed up at the opening of the restaurant to see if there were any last minute cancellations and were thrilled to be offered two seats at the bar that are normally reserved for friends of the chef. The atmosphere was very cozy and welcoming and I loved the decor. The bar staff and servers were very friendly and very knowledgeable. The six-course tasting menu was interesting and my husband opted for the wine pairing. The main meat course was pigeon, which wasn't exactly to either my husband or I's like, but we were happy to try something new. The smoked trout to start was excellent.

As a top 50 rated restaurant with a michelin star I expected dishes that were more inventive and flavorful. We did dine at lunch, but I was ensured that lunch was just as good as dinner when we were unable to get a dinner reservation. The price to quality of food ratio was too high in my opinion for the meal I had. I also was frustrated when I received cuttlefish. I had dined at Clamato the night before and had almost the exact same dish. I understand the two restaurants are connected, but I wanted a unique meal. We made a lot of effort to get a reservation and walked away disappointed. The best part of the meal was the unique wine pairing and the lovely service.

Recommend,moomickey,0,2018-03-12,"Managed to get a 7:30pm reservation for 2 people. The fixed menu is 80 Euro each for 8 courses and 55 Euro for the 8 glass wine pairing; which I highly recommend. You also have access to a full wine list if you don’t fancy the wine pairing.
The fixed menu was dynamic and surprising, with the hot dishes being the highlight while the wine pairing was definitely the best part: starting with sake and then a mix of wines, and a cider to go with one of the desserts.

The service was good and efficient and waitresses were mostly attentive.
An expensive visit that you won’t be able to do often but makes a very nice treat to see a more relaxed and tasty side of Paris.

Septime came very highly recommended however and we decided to give it a try. It was very good and my partner puts it ahead of Le Chateaubriand but I don't agree. All of the courses were very good but none were in my view memorable. I realise that I am perhaps judging it too harshly since it is a fine restaurant but give me its Avenue Paramentier rival any day for food, wine pairing and service. ",2017-09-01,1,5,Sunday,February
Worth the reservation hassle,Michella L,0,2018-01-28,"I wasn't able to get the dinner reservation and settled for the lunch reservation. I was blown away. The taste was innovative while still really good and enjoyable until the last bite. Due to the highly reasonable price of the menu, they understandably did not use 'wow-factor' ingredients. However they definitely make those ordinary ingredients into amazing dishes.

If you were deciding between Frenchie and Septime, I highly advise you to choose Septime.

Excellent in almost every way,wanderluster_rs,0,2018-01-08,"Firstly, get your phone on standby 21 days before the day you want to dine at Septime, because it is almost impossible to get a spot here. I set an alarm to call as soon as they opened the reservations up and the line was literally impossible to get through. I was lucky after 3 days of trying and managed to bag a spot for lunch. When I got there, the place was empty as other diners had not arrived but the place soon filled up and there were no available seats left. The decor is simple and rustic, which is one of the things I loved about Septime - its not pretentious and focuses on the most important elements of a food establishment like the food and service. Each of the courses were fantastic. Highlights for me were the eel wrapped in Foie gras, roasted chicken and the dessert with sabayon. The wine pairing had some great selections and each course was paired perfectly. By the end of the meal, I was highly impressed and walked out with a smile on my face as rarely does a place exceed the already high expectations I usually have.
My only complaint - I requested for a copy of the menu to be emailed to me which has not been done till now.
Otherwise a must try and would definitely head back on my next visit.",2017-12-01,3,5,Monday,January
Very special but limited menu,JosephTopTravel,0,2017-12-28,"We enjoyed our meal very much. Take under consideration a few things: it's a fixed menu, you choose the main dish from 2 options, if you don't like them so you have a problem, if you do you are lucky and enjoy the amazing food.

Amazing experience! Off the beaten path....,petualang,0,2017-12-23,"It wasn't easy to get a table here as they don't accept email or online booking. They only take booking up to three weeks in advance. And you have to call directly. However, it was all so worth the experience. I love the casual ambiance. The food exquisitely delicious and very well executed. The staff was friendly, attentive and highly knowledgeable. It's rather off the beaten path. Highly recommended and I can't wait to return. The price was also quite reasonable for what you get.",2017-12-01,1,5,Saturday,December
What an experience!,jm16,0,2017-11-11,Not easy to get reservations. So happy we did. it was a great experience. The food was fantastic. The staff was so friendly and the wine pairing was perfect.

Don't believe the hype,Laura S,0,2017-11-09,"It might have been an off day but we were not impressed. The menu was eh and the service was worse. I watch the kitchen staff break down the kitchen while I waited 40 mins for my desert. The wine pairing was also poured out of sync, like 10 mins before each dish arrived.

We were so excited to come here. It took me a year to get a reservation and I was terribly disappointed. At no point did my waitress even ask if we enjoyed our lunch...and clearly we did not. I expected more. We go to Clamato all the time and think that it is so much better. Do yourself a favor, skip Septime and go to their sister, Clamato. Service is nicer and food is tastier, imo.

We will not return. Sorry but you are out, Septime.",2017-09-01,3,3,Thursday,November
Superb Meal,Oaklandish3,0,2017-11-08,"Other than its reservation system which is super hard for anyone from abroad - why not let there be some seats for on-line reservations? Our connection in Paris actually had to go to the restaurant twice in order to get us a reservation. However, we were not disappointed. The room is casual and there is little of the pretense that you get in restaurants with more stars. Service as spot-on and the sommelier's wine recommendations were excellent. Every course was enjoyed by our entire group of 4 and we especially were enthralled with the scallops and the pre-dessert of mushroom panna cotta. AT 80E without wine, it isn't cheap but for the quality, creativity and generosity of the food, we felt it worth it and by 'fine dining' standards a bargain.",2017-10-01,1,5,Wednesday,November
Lunch; Four courses of Boredom. ,W3616OTchristianb,0,2017-10-10,"When I ate at Septime in 2015, I was amazed by the quality of the food, the inventive pairings and the simple beauty of the presentation. My visit this time left me completely cold. I couldn't say that it was bad and I'm not upset having spent my money there, but I really cannot understand why there should be a waiting list for tables. Two lacklustre starters, one roast bird that passes muster without leaving any great impression and a good, but uninspired dessert and I'm wondering where they found the star. Go to the sister restaurant Clamato next door and you will be much better served. ",2017-10-01,5,3,Tuesday,October

Glad I could try it!,amanda benton d,0,2017-07-26,"Scored a lunch reservation so I was happy to finally get to try Septime as everyone raves about it! The neighborhood is definitely off the beaten path and a very different part of Paris than I've had the chance to explore so it was neat to be somewhere different. The restaurant itself is very charming and beautiful and the lovely garden out back by the restrooms is gorgeous, they've really landed themselves a nice spot!

Since we did lunch we had the option of fish or protein so my husband and I both ordered one of each. Great price for a lunch course meal and still an element of surprise. I thought the food was definitely innovative and exciting, though we had just dined at Verjus and has a dish similar to the lobster rolled in cabbage there so it was something we had just seen. Although the lobster and sauce were fantastic here! The poultry, it wasn't chicken although they advertised it as chicken, was delectable, the skin nice and crispy. Definitely wonderful. The monk fish was good, but not great. I have a hard time thinking fish is the most fabulous because it's hard to take something so simple and reinvent the wheel by adding more flavors. Preferred the monk fish at Frenchie on the same trip. The salad was lovely and light and airy for a hot July day. The dessert, gosh, my husband didn't mind it but those pine needles.. they're so hard to eat! They don't process in your mouth very well so I understand the fragrance and artistry of them but they're not very delectable.

I'd definitely be curious to come back for dinner and try a larger menu. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Septime but on this particular trip, my mind was on how amazing the experience at Frenchie was.. Guess you shouldn't try all the places you want to try on one trip because you're bound to have favorites!! Just being honest about my experience.

I definitely liked Septime and would like to go back but it didn't stand out as my most memorable meal.",2017-07-01,0,4,Wednesday,July

First class AND reasonably priced!,n8fire,0,2017-07-10,"No wonder it's hard to get a reservation at Septime. The food is fanstastic and you won't break the bank eating there. As a matter of fact we were only able to get a reservation for lunch. We were not disappointed.

At Septime you are quite far away from the pretentiousness of some of the top restaurant however the quality and creativity of what gets in your plate is not diminished at all. Our prix fixe lunch was simply spectacular!

Service was also excellent through the experience which is no small feat considering how inexpensive all things considered it was.

I seriously need to get a table for dinner next time I am in Paris!",2017-05-01,0,5,Monday,July
"Amazing, sublime, a reputation well deserved",100CountriesNow,0,2017-06-22,"I finally got a reservation at Septime, after poking around on the internet for the better part of two months. I invited some friends along. It was a hot day in Paris (35 degrees) and the restaurant has no air conditioning, but the food managed to rise above the heat and the hype. We had the fixed lunch menu (carte blanche) for 42 Euros. The first starter was a cooling entree - truffle mushrooms in soya, with many other little delicious things floating around in the sauce. The second starter was heavenly - I just remember the lobster, and the asparagus, but there was a whole bunch of other flavours in there. The main course was a choice between monk fish and guinea fowl - I went for the latter, which tasted great with the shallots, but this was the only course that I think could have been more exciting. Finally the dessert was a sorbet, with gin and almonds floating in a soup around it. It was heavenly - and for a moment one forgot the heat completely. We washed this all down with a St Emilion red against the recommedations of the the bartender given the heat - but we savoured every last drop of this as well. Septime has become an institution - and it is shocking that they manage to live up to the well deserved hype day in and day out. A must visit!",2017-06-01,0,5,Thursday,June

Every dish that was brought to us was described by the waiting staff, and accompanied by a matched wine. The food and wine were delicious and consisted of some very imaginative compositions, taste-wise and visually. The environment was very vibrant and the waiting staff were charming. The chef did an amazing job of making some alterations to handle a couple of allergies on our table - a very much appreciated touch. Definitely the best restaurant of my trip to Paris.

Every dish was perfect in its way and every course followed the course before elegantly and logically. The service is marvellous, the sommelier helpful, never trying to sell the expensive option. If I was to recommend just one restaurant in Paris this would be it. No chandeliers, no lace tablecloths, no Piaf, just food that's cleverly conceived, perfectly balanced, nicely presented and very, very yummy. Thank you Septime. We'll be back. And back. And back.",2017-05-01,1,5,Saturday,May
Lovely Dinner ,blake166,0,2017-05-20,"Overall, highly recommend. We were told by our hotel that mostly Americans would be there, but we were pleasantly surprised to find it more of a local spot. If you don't speak French don't let that dissuade you as most of the staff speaks great English. The prix fixe menu is well thought out and wonderful fresh food. My only reason for not leaving 5 stars is because on two occasions my cocktail was taken before I was finished with it! Go to this restaurant and hang on to your drink.",2017-02-01,1,4,Saturday,May
Flavors you never knew would mix well together ,isableski,0,2017-05-17,"The experience at Septime is once- in-a-lifetime. We arrived at the earliest seating time which allowed us to enjoy the ambiance. We then had some appertifs, the daily infused water (which is highly recommended if you take the metro to the restaurant on a warm day). Then we began receiving the many courses and wine pairings. All were incredible, to say the least. But the takeaway is that the chef plays with vegetables and fruits and mixes with unexpected flavors. The meal was one of our best in Paris and highly recommended!

Tip: get the wine pairing, I doubt I will ever get a wine pairing as good as this one!",2017-05-01,0,5,Wednesday,May
A Very Different Dining Experience at one of Paris Hot Spots,phd2,0,2017-03-28,"Firstly if you're thinking of visiting Septime make sure you book well in advance. You still may not get in as this is incredibly popular - out of the way, in a small space and not that easy to get to.

With its Michelin Star and excellent service the only thing you really have to know is that the menu is set, there isn't a choice, and you'd best not go if you're famished. Each dish is beautifully presented but very small. And although there are quite a few there is not that much protein as Septime specialises in vegetable dishes.

The only things that disappointed were the desserts both of which looked similar. But overall it was very good indeed. Well worth a visit, just to try something different from all the played about food you can find in Paris.",2017-03-01,1,4,Tuesday,March

A dining experience,BremenCologne,0,2017-02-03,"This place is so popular we booked 2 months in advance for the Michelin Star restaurant and enjoyed a very pleasant evening with French friends.
We had the degustation menu consisting of 6 courses that provided a real variety of tastes,all being excellent.
The wine selection was superb and we enjoyed 3 very good wines, from the Loire (sauvignon blanc) one from the Languedoc region (chardonnay) and robust Spanish wine ""Cojon De Gato""
We found the staff extremely friendly and helpful, providing excellent introductions to each course in both French and English.
Although one of our more expensive evenings out in Paris this time the whole experience made it well worth while.
We would recommend it and hope to visit next time we are in Paris",2017-01-01,1,5,Friday,February
"Lovely dinner, extremely hard to get a reservation",465villel,0,2017-01-30,I would say the whole dinner was a great experience. Interesting and new tastes but still simple enough. Wine set was extremely good and complimented the food really well. We ordered one wine set to share for two persons since it was quite a lot to drink. It would have been nice if they could have offered it in two glasses even if for a small extra fee. Now we got one glass and had to share the glass. Some oysters in one dish weren't good but this flaw was quickly repaired by replacing the dish with another with grilled clams.,2016-12-01,0,5,Monday,January

Glad I've made it! Incredible food!,Fkest,0,2017-01-21,"Septime is an exquisite Michelin-starred restaurant in the heart of 11th district (Rue de Charonne) that serves fantastic french-driven bites. They prepare a different menu from time to time; I went for lunch and refuted the degustation alternative. Instead, I've chosen a three-course menu: (i) Héliantis rôti, pralin anchous et colatura (tasted like artichokes, and it was wondrous); (ii) Merlan de Ligne, beurre blanc au savagnin (best fish I had in Paris); and (iii) Fromages de la maison Quatrehomme (couldn't be better). Along with my food, I've asked for a natural red wine pairing and it was incredible. As all reviewers pointed out, it's not easy to get a table. But for sure it's worth trying!

Amazing,davyc71,0,2016-12-29,"Our hotel concierge helped us get this reservation, which I had heard was otherwise difficult to get. I had walked into this restaurant not knowing much about it other than from rave recommendations from friends. I walked out thinking that this is one of the best restaurants I had ever eaten at in terms of cuisine. Innovative dishes, creative pairings of ingredients, and just such refinement in its combination of texture and flavors. There is no shortage of pictures and more specific descriptions of the cuisine from other posters, so I will not be redundant.

Service was generally efficient and not-unfriendly. I think being able to speak French would have helped us better understand the descriptions of the dishes.

The double dessert was nothing like i have tasted before. Service is excellent too (ingredients explained in english or french for the surprise/tasting menu). Excellent selection of wines.

"Go, if you love food",raysy,0,2016-10-05,"Dysfunctional website ... almost impossible to get a booking … no name on the premises … theatrical grunge décor… open kitchen … packed out. Must be the 50th best restaurant in the world!
Just succeeded (four weeks in advance) in getting a lunch booking here when visiting Paris for a quick fix of Bastille Opera (medium rare Tosca).
Loved the place from the start. All staff highly professional, personable, competent and uber-cool. Spoke French when we wanted and English when we needed.
Had the six course tasting lunch (great value at €60). Surprise menu - so no point describing plates in detail. However, must mention beautifully cooked and presented John Dory (plum and vinegar sauce); veal sweetbreads (with amazing mussel sauce). Uncomplicated cooking with genius and original combinations of ingredients. Startlingly good mixes of tastes dished up with impeccable cool.
One tiny tiny quibble were the two dessert dishes … these followed the current trend in many “star” restaurants of being assemblages rather than cooked/baked desserts. They were good - raspberry /rhubarb and a new take on Ile Flottante, but if Septime produced desserts to the equivalent relative quality of their four savoury plates then who knows how they would be rated in the culinary firmament.
Excellent support/ help with the wine, and a tiny quibble with the bill was more than compensated for in a most gracious manner.
Amazing value at €200 for two … an exceptional experience from a team led by the scarily young but very original Bertrand Grebaut makes it good to be alive..

Septum was so accommodating allowed me to have just vegetarian which was so delicious and flavoursome I didn't even feel jealous when I saw meats I like come out to my dining companions.

Great Fun!,Jim P,0,2016-07-16,"So this is what one Michelin star looks like these days: bare walls and floors, rough wood tables, a breezy and helpful young staff who look like a high-school cooking club -- and a six-course tasting menu for 60 Euros per person at lunch (aperos and two obscure and tasty wines included) that was worth every centime.
I'm usually skeptical of menus, from which you come away over-fed and stuffed. Here the portions are well-managed, and they avoid a lot of the extras that create an illusion of impressive complexity.
Five years on, and -- unless you get lucky on a drop-in -- you still need to struggle through a needlessly complex reservation process. I snuck in at the wire to book four of us for lunch, and we had a thoroughly delightful time.
Pointless to recount the menu details -- it changes all the time. Leave your old-school expectations behind, go prepared to relax, and enjoy!",2016-07-01,3,5,Saturday,July

Top-notch dining in Le Marais,markfT5463KJ,0,2016-07-14,"We booked reservations for lunch here several weeks in advance. This restaurant more than earns its Michelin star - every course of our 6-course tasting menu was excellent. We asked the sommelier (or at least the waiter we were directed to with our wine questions) for a recommendation to pair with the food since we didn't know what food would be coming out - he steered us to a mid-priced red Burgundy that was possibly the best bottle of wine we had during our two-week trip, and it went beautifully with almost all the dishes. The food was traditional but playful - the beef carpaccio came out with a raw egg yolk underneath, which I've seen with tartare but not with carpaccio, and it also had little nuggets of tart fruit strewn among the beef, which went deliciously with the fat in the meat and egg. The atmosphere was casual but elegant, and the waitstaff were all very attentive and friendly. I'd definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for fine dining in a laid-back setting.

Best Meal We've Had,ecadams87,0,2016-07-02,"We snagged a lunch reservation here for the first day of our honeymoon -- and boy did it get the trip off on the right foot! Every course was simple and straightforward, with bold, interesting flavors. The ambiance of the restaurant is also relaxed and straightforward: while the food was some of the best we've ever eaten, it felt so effortless -- a far cry from other stuffy Parisian restaurants who seem to scream at the top of their lungs how hard they are working to craft this experience for you. If I could, I would eat at Septime every day and I don't think I would ever get bored.",2016-06-01,0,5,Saturday,July
Wonderful lunch in Paris!,Janet B,0,2016-06-29,"Visited Septime this past month. I made the reservation 3 weeks in advance, per suggestion, for lunch. I want to report there were empty tables available, however. You could take your chances but why? This was, by far, our best meal in Paris. My daughter and I had the three course lunch and it was delicious and a perfect amount of food. Flavors were fun and perfectly designed. If I went again, I would have the wine pairing. The only downside was that we had a number of different wait staff(all very nice) throughout our hour and a half and they were quite busy getting ready for dinner. So a little lacking in attention, which I get because it's lunchtime. Maybe dinner provides more consistent service. If you get the chance to visit Paris, visit Septime.

Terrible night,cintra1978,0,2016-06-23,"I asked the concierge from my hotel in Paris two days ago to get a reservation for the Septime Restaurant, for this Thursday. I was taken aback when I got there and they said the concierge had lied to me since they are fully booked for the next two months and they could not have made the reservation. Later on they found out the reservation had been made on my surname, slightly different though, for two days before. It is weird to think that a restaurant which boasts of being so busy was able to make a last minute reservation for the same day even though I meant it for two days later. The whole time they put the blame on us and the hotel for the wrong booking. The restaurant staff was very arrogant and clearly not organized at all - not to mention beginners. We left the place very frustrated but at the same time relieved - the place didn't seem pleasant, very hot and the atmosphere seemed quite down, with few tables occupied.
We went to Joel Rebouchon from there and even though we had no reservation they treated us lovely and in a professional way - just how it should be. Septime never again",2016-06-01,5,1,Thursday,June
Worth the visit,dodo4u,0,2016-06-20,"Managed to find an opening online and booked it rightaway.

Highly recommended!",2016-06-01,0,5,Monday,June
A meal that is of the highest quality and matching wines that really challenged our thinking,John T,0,2016-06-15,"We had the 7 course menu with matching wines and the meal was exquisite. The matching wines were excellent (not what I would normally have selected). The blend of ingredients and cooking styles created flavours and textures that were some of the best dishes I have had. You could see they took great pride and professionalism in their cooking and the wait staff were very well trained in the menu and serving. This is well worth booking ahead for and visiting. We stayed at the Exquis across the road, so a great combination.",2016-06-01,0,5,Wednesday,June
Well worth the hassle of getting online in time to book,Maitreyib,0,2016-05-28,"We got there ten minutes late for a 1330 reservation and had to,wit for a table. Staff friendly, soured us it would not be long, asked if we wanted a drink at bar while waiting, and brought us a plate of delicious, moist ham.
Plain wooden tables with no table cloths, rather austere, but it all worked. We were assured the kitchen would not close at 1400 until we had ordered and eaten!
Carefully prepared food, fresh, seasonal ingredients. We had to book exactly three weeks in advance , and the time slots go very quickly. We had a wonderful meal. Would definitely recommend. Could take metro there, although a longish walk. Neighborhood did not look like much, but oh, the food!",2016-04-01,1,4,Saturday,May

So many unnecessary reservation hurdles...,acmegumbo,0,2016-05-05,"...mean we will never again make the effort. The restaurant makes reservations only by telephone (the website's reservation system never works) 3 weeks out and then only a couple hours per day. I set an alarm for 2:55 a.m. my time in order to make a call at 3 a.m. (10 a.m. Paris time). For 30 minutes and 20 or so calls I got a busy signal or a recording; I finally got through to a bored woman who could have cared less. She told me I was first on the waiting list for a reservation and that if there were cancellations I would be telephoned. I followed up by telephone to follow up a number of time, but the telephone was answered only once; I was told I was No. 2 on the waiting list. I protested and was advised I was No. 1 for a table for 2. In any event I never received a call. What are the odds of this restaurant not having a single cancellation or no show? My bet: nil. My recommendation: go elsewhere and avoid being lied to and otherwise jacked around.",2016-05-01,10,1,Thursday,May

Amazing lunch at a good value,N0rwegianGirl,0,2016-04-19,"We wanted to go here for dinner, but it was impossible to get reservations. However, we managed to get lunch reservations and settled for that. There was a choice between a three course or a six course lunch. We went with the three course menu and that we got a good value for our money. I have added the menu to the review (just in French). The service was also very good and the waiters were good in explaining each course in English. Their wine selection sold on glass was not too big, however the wines were of a very good quality. One of the best wines I had during my trip to Paris this time. I would highly recommend this restaurant for lunch, and also if you are so lucky to get dinner reservations.",2016-04-01,4,5,Tuesday,April
The one french bistrot to try,FoodStache,0,2016-04-03,"Septime has been around for quite some years already and is often regarded as one of the first upscale bistrot that helped establish this trend in Paris. It's surely one place to visit when in Paris; for lunch or dinner to try their daily changing tasting menu, with a fresh and inventive take on french classics, using awesome products. They also have a very interesting wine selection and all of that is served by friendly staff in a relaxed bistrot atmosphere.",2015-09-01,1,5,Sunday,April

Awful experience dba restaurant nightmare,Allen F,0,2016-02-12,"I have made two dozen trips to Paris over the years and am a foodie. We stay always in a lovely 5 star hotel and their staff is wonderful and always book our restaurants a month in advance. We always mix bistros, new hip joints and grand Michelin 1-2-3 restaurants. On this trip we booked Tallivant, Joel Rubuchon, Dominique Bouchart, Violin de Inglas, Frenchie, Spring, Guy Savoy , and Septime.

Our hotel makes the reservation by phone, follows by email. They reconfirmed by phone and email both one day and one week before, a triple check system. This was done with Septime. When we arrived we were told we had no reservation. I showed the manager our confirmation. I then called our hotel and asked then to speak to the restaurant manager. I made him pull the computerized reservation list and our name was on it. He argued that was the wait list. He argued with the hotel manager for 15 minutes, screaming and would not return my phone limit was a scene. Later I saw all the email responses from septime confirming our reservation which the hotel saved.
We were BUMPED it is that simple. SNOBBY Septime figured we were Americans and were not repeat visitors hence our table was given to some one they knew who was an important customer. This was inexcusable and ruined our night. I recommend all visitors stay from this Snobby restaurant with the rudest people I have ever encountered in Paris. This was my WORST restaurant experience ever",2016-02-01,20,1,Friday,February

Outstanding,newboldimages,0,2016-02-07,"I visited Paris with my work colleagues and the restaurant was booked by my French colleague. He said it was highly regarded and he was not wrong.

We had the 7 course taster menu and the waitress ( who spoke wonderfully good English) was very accommodating. Each course was introduced to explain what was being served. It was described with a depth of knowledge and delivered not in a condescending manner but with passion and pride.

I had a sea food allergy which was not a problem at all for them it's alternatives being presented without fuss. You just let them know what you need to avoid at the start of the meal. No problem.

Some of my colleagues are 'foodies' and they raved about it. I am less adventurous, but nevertheless you could not fail to be impressed by the quality of service ambience or food. If I had the chance to visit again: I would without question",2016-02-01,0,5,Sunday,February

Service was good. The surroundings are charming, reservations are hard to get but it is...a lot of hype and not much there. I wouldn't go back even if I were in the neighborhood and a reservation was easily available.

Not memorable. Too hyped up for its own good (or maybe I just have horrible taste).,Suemen,0,2015-11-28,"Considering the fact that it took FOREVER to make a reservation (meaning that I only managed to make a reservation when I physically presented myself in person. I must have tried a thousand times to reserve by phone and on their website but to no avail to the point that I wondered if the website worked at all. Minus 500 points already for this headache of an online reservation system), I had high expectations of Septime, judging by all the good reviews, the one star Michelin rating and the fact that it takes an approximate 3 week wait before you actually get a seat.

Ever so excited, we got seated on Thanksgiving night and was presented with the carte blanche menu of an amuse-bouche, 2 appetizers, 2 mains and 2 desserts for 65 euros per person. It's a surprise menu that is the same for everyone else during the night, although they do take into consideration any food allergies or particular needs before serving.

The end verdict? My husband and I both agree that the meal was not memorable in the least bit. Perhaps that sliver of duck a col vert that we had as one of the mains was quite tender, but aside from that, the dining experience didn't exactly make me claw at the waiter to make a second reservation. We both agreed we had a better surprise menu at Le 6 Paul Bert in the neighbourhood and for way cheaper (45 euros).

As the menu keeps changing, perhaps we were there on an off-night? Hard to compare. I guess I might have to make another reservation and come back here again with a friend to see if it really is all that or once again another disappointment.

Not to mention that I found a single man's hair in one of my entrees, but unfortunately only discovered that once I had finished the entree.

Also, it's a bit loud in the restaurant when it fills up. As if all the fancy food terminology isn't lost in translation already, the high decibal level of the resto makes it that much harder to understand the food descriptions coming out of their mouths as they present each dish.

One of the best,swinifredb,0,2015-11-22,"Original, and delicious food served by attentive, enthusiastic waiters (who will describe your dishes in English if you wish) presented in a beautifully designed room that is both spare and warm. Vegetables are honored, but the meats and fish are also perfectly cooked. There are taste revelations in each course, including dessert, e.g. dehydrated capers on rich chocolate sorbet. This is a form of haute cuisine that is not haughty. It's exciting, locally sourced, carefully prepared and stunning. The portions on the tasting menus are thoughtful--not huge--but not tiny as some reviewers have suggested. And the price is reasonable. ",2015-11-01,1,5,Sunday,November
"Relaxed, flawless service and original, fresh delicious food",AmericanInLondon2013,0,2015-11-13,"My husband and I had an unforgettable Friday lunch with the six-course tasting menu. The service was professional, calm and friendly - and unobtrusive. The food was fresh, relatively light and original - and stand-outs were the celeriac 'pasta' ribbons with egg yolk and crushed nuts and the chocolate sorbet with semi dried capers (yes, really). The atmosphere was exposed brick and filament light bulbs, but not in an overly-industrial way. You can peek out to the tiny cottage-y kitchen garden in the back. I would highly recommend this restaurant and it was worth the hassle of ringing three weeks ahead promptly at opening time to bag a reservation. Don't miss.",2015-11-01,1,5,Friday,November

Difficult to Reserve But Great Food,D T,0,2015-11-07,"This restaurant is so difficult to get a reservation that I’m not sure it is worthwhile—even though I enjoyed the food. That calendar on their website is enough to cause nightmares after trying over and over and accomplishing nothing. I thought it was a miracle when finally one day opened up on that calendar and it was actually the day I wanted. I grabbed it so quick that I really felt like I had just accomplished something huge. Interestingly, when I arrived at the restaurant about 30 minutes early, there were already about 20 people standing around waiting to get in. I’ve never seen that before in Paris. And, another thing I have never seen in Paris is that they actually opened 20 minutes early and let people in. I was blown away by that. I had the 3-course lunch for 30E. I had the Bonite crue, rhubarb et crème au raifort for my entré, the Lieu (Pollack fish) jaune de lige, sauce poivron-nduja for the plat and fromages affinés (1 hard cow cheese and 1 soft goat cheese) for dessert. The brown bread was soft and fresh with a great crunchy crust. Honestly, I had agreed to meet someone there for lunch whom I met on the Paris Forum. We had such an enjoyable time together that I didn’t pay a lot of attention to the food. However, from what I noticed, everything was delicious and I would certainly go again—if someone else was making the reservation! ",2015-09-01,1,5,Saturday,November
Superb long lunch,Michele R,0,2015-11-07,"Septime, 80 rue de Charonne, 75011 Paris. I’m a solo traveler, not a chef, nor am I a restaurant critic, but I love good food, beautifully prepared and presented and was not disappointed.
Once again it was raining as I set off for my lunch time reservation but luckily it had stopped before I got to the restaurant as the taxi driver even with GPS got lost and dropped me off a few blocks away.
There were only a few diners there when I arrived but the restaurant was full by the time I left a good few hours later. The restaurant is light and feels spacious. If lucky enough you will be seated in the main dinning area in front of the kitchen where you are able to watch the staff as they prepare the meals. When travelling solo this can be a pleasant way to pass the time between courses.
While the menu looked delicious I opted for the 6 course “Carte Blanche Midi”. When ordering, the staff ask if you have any allergies, likes and dislikes. A lot of people around me had also ordered the Carte Blanche and as far as I could see, no two meals came out exactly the same; they were tailored to your tastes and likes. The menu changes regularly but some of my favourites were the scallops with radishes, bone marrow with parsley and gherkins, a dish of squid hood, beans and tomatoes with a delicious peppery oil dressing which gave the beans a lot of flavour and the lamb which came with green beans, spinach and a light airy foam. The waiter told me the chef cooking the meats while I was there was a young Canadian chef. The lamb was sublime, perfectly cooked and just melted in my mouth.
The wine list has a good range of natural wines, I think this means they are sulphur free, The wine recommended after I told the waiter what sort of wine I liked was superb, so nice I had two glasses.
The staff working on the day I visited had a good grasp of English and were able to explain the dishes as they were delivered. They were professional, courteous and discreet with a good knowledge of the menu and wines.
Total cost including glass of champagne, 2 wines, water and the 6 course Carte Blanche was 93 Euro. I would most certainly go back to sample even more of the beautifully prepared food.",2015-09-01,2,5,Saturday,November

Stunning!,ecf1,0,2015-10-15,"This is among the best -- the very best? -- restaurants we've been to in Paris on eight trips over more than 20 years. It is very hard to get a reservation -- three weeks in advance to the day, and at 12 noon Paris time -- but we got one online at the exact moment. I began with a bouillon of champignons with a cooked egg yolk where, at first bite, I ate the best mushroom of my life. Stunning. Everything fully flavored, and clearly worked for a long, long time. I followed with steak ""Montbeliarde"", a breed of cow I didn't know from well south of Paris, with great greens and caramelized carrots (can I say ""stunning"" again?). My wife went the fish direction: raw tuna with pear, and a line-caught Merlu. All terrific. We ended with a plate of tomme de Savoie and a brie de Meaux, then a dessert mont blanc with strange curly chestnut strands that looked like pasta on top. Surreal and delicious! The small menu changes weekly. Wines are impeccable, including an orange wine from northern Italy. The price was excellent for the quality.

Why go to Paris if you're not going to eat at Septime?,chelseagilson,0,2015-09-29,"I suppose I'll start with what I consider the best. It would be an absolute shame to go to Paris and not eat at Septime. The tasting menu is inventive with fresh and flavorful dishes that tickle your tastebuds and leave you wonderfully satisfied. The service is perfect, the wines exquisite, the atmosphere charming. There's a reason why there's a three week wait for reservations at Septime, and that is because the chef knows what he is doing. The beautiful thing about Septime is that the 7 course dinner is constantly changing with the season, so every time you go will be fresh and exciting. This is also wonderful for Americans who may not speak perfect (a lick) of French past bonjour and merci. The tasting menu takes all of the guest work out of trying to decipher the menu. All you have to do is sit back, point to which bottle of red you can afford, and remember to add the cheese board to your dessert.

Septime is located in the 11th, an area unscathed by tourist zombies. You have to make reservations 3 weeks in advance (or pray to the champagne Gods for a cancellation).",2015-09-01,1,5,Tuesday,September

Yes, you do need to get a reservation, but it is totally worth it. Yes, it is a little from the center of town, but it is fun to see a new area. We had the bone marrow with mussels for our starter, the yellow chicken for our main, and cheese for the last course. Everything was of great quality. Cannot wait to revisit!",2015-09-01,0,5,Sunday,September
Wonderful French Fare,mary m,22,2015-09-10,"The food here is excellent! The menu changes daily because the chef buys local. The result is wonderful food.

Book three weeks in advance,Ariel_Xianne,0,2015-08-02,"Septime is probably one of the toughest restaurants to get a reservation in Paris. However, giving consideration to the price we paid (about 40 euro per person), the food here is just PERFECT. They only serve set menu which never goes wrong.

Finally found a table!,Flami1990,0,2015-07-30,"After months of trial I finally get a table at Septime.

Delightful Lunch,nhes,0,2015-07-25,"Yes, reservations are difficult for to get but try calling for lunch. I never could get the website system to work but made a lunch reservation by phone about 3 weeks out.
The lunch was delicious, lighter than some of our other meals and a ""just right"" portion. I think that is a sign of a well-planned meal, leAving the diner wanting no more or less.
The waitstaff were patient and notably helpful in providing English translations when we hit a snag. I also appreciated their wine pairing suggestions and the reasonable wine prices.
The lunch menu is a good value given the quality of food and service. The menu changes so I won't recommend one dish over another but will say the lunch here is a great way to experience an Michelin starred restaurant in Paris.",2015-07-01,2,5,Saturday,July
Amazing!,Thecantys,0,2015-07-20,We visited for lunch as it was the only table available during our stay in Paris and we had the most amazing food and wine. The best plate of food I have ever tasted.

Original food with fresh ingredients but limited selection,workingmom001,0,2015-07-12,"Found Septime in 2015 Lonely Planet guidebook. Made lunch reservation for three of us that same morning. Did not realize that the one menu had only 2 appetizers, 2 mains, and 2 desserts from which to choose. Really enjoyed 1 of the appetizers (raw tuna with cherries). And liked the fresh produce in all 3 courses. However the steak and fish mains were bland plus the steak had gristle, and the steamed apricot dessert was overly sugared with homemade granola. Still, a good change from the heavier French food we’d been eating.",2015-06-01,0,3,Sunday,July
Hard to get a table,EuroEpicure,13,2015-07-08,"If you can get a table - go!

My favourite restaurant,Dave P,0,2015-06-26,"I know that these days it's pretty impossible to get a table, and that the food is getting slightly more 'out there'. But I've quite simply never been disappointed.

They're not giving the food away, but there's a real value for money there. The dishes are well worked and the advice on the wine has always been impeccable. Unfortunately, some may find themselves disappointed because of the expectation that accompanies such a long wait (not to mention the hype).

If you go with an open mind, you'll come away happy. I always have.",2015-02-01,1,5,Friday,June
Truly terrific. Get your concierge to help you with reservations. Do it far in advance.,moodbeast,0,2015-06-18,"It's a shame the previous review gave Septime an angry 2 star review because our experience was the total opposite. We loved our 7 course dinner. The portions weren't big, but they certainly weren't small either. My husband was very pleased with the wine pairing (he knows a fair amount, more than I). There was a couple beside us who had some pretty ridiculous food ""allergies"" and they managed to serve them some substantial dishes, and I didn't think the server had any kind of attitude about it. We tried our best to speak French, but the staff were very accommodating and spoke English as well. I wouldn't take children here. The atmosphere is more grown up. Plenty of foodie tourists, since this place gets a lot of press. The reservation system online is a bit much. That was the only drawback for us. Would love to come back again. I didn't think the price was expensive at all. Comparable with San Francisco. Mid-priced ($140 pp WITH wine pairings).",2015-06-01,0,5,Thursday,June
Inexcusable!,Theroux804,0,2015-06-17,"The owners and Chef Bertrand Grebaut really need to take a good hard look at what they are trying to achieve here. Many reviewers talk about the difficulty in booking a table at Septime, I walked in off the street and was shown to a table. ""Lucky fella"" I hear you say, not a bit of it! It's true I'd read a few articles and was looking forward to the experience, I was also hungry, generally a prerequisite of mine for having dinner.

Well, the set menu of seven tasting plates is not going to do it for you, I promise. Tiny portions, combinations that have no place on the same plate, extremely long waiting periods between courses and paired wines that are in some cases so extreme that you leave the restaurant with the knowledge that tomorrow morning has ""hangover"" written all over it. You will also leave hungry and considerably poorer.

A family of four were having dinner next to me, I genuinely felt sorry for them. They had arrived before me and yet their plates were arriving after mine and with even longer waiting periods, they were obviously hungry and were visibly embarrassed at the meagre portions which may well have satisfied a Parisian catwalk queen but were never going to satisfy anyone not on a strict diet.

So Chef Bertrand, was it just a bad night? I won't be back to find out, you may be an innovative chef but it's time you put your customers first.",2015-06-01,3,2,Wednesday,June
Good hipster food,SasquatchShu,0,2015-06-08,"After reading many reviews about this restaurant about the hail and hellfire traversed to get a booking I must say it was not too difficult in our case. We called exactly about 3 weeks before estimated date and happily were given a lunch table.

The restaurant itself is situated slightly out of the way, not in the traditional areas one might consider foodie central as are many hipster restaurants the world over. We went for the tasting menu which at the time was good but nothing that I can recall specifically 2 months down the line.

Fresh produce, attentive service, nice albeit cramped decor. Perhaps not a destination place but if you can get a booking, why not.",2015-04-01,1,4,Monday,June
Exquisite ,Steven M,0,2015-05-30,"I worked very hard to get this reservation for lunch, but it was definitely worth the work. They only take reservations exactly three weeks prior to the day on their website - reserve early in the day because they will all be gone quickly. I read the Perierre ratings that drew me to this place. They do have bar seats that seemed to be open for lunch, but I wouldn't risk it and get the reso.
It is a quaint little restaurant with a beautiful open design and great view of the kitchen. The staff were very friendly and spoke wonderful English to get us through a meal. They were only offering a prix fix menu because it was a Holiday. We did the pairing a it was perfect.
1-bonito trout, mango and zucchini
2- pea purée, strawberry, fava bean, truffle oil - Pinot Gris
3 - buffa cheese sauce, white asparagus and pickled onion - champagne
4- Chardonnay - torbot, spinach/white spinach and artichoke purée
5- orange wine - Italian - quail, spinach, mustard leaf and herb purée
Chèvre course - with beer
6- Vergano Mauro vermouth - elderflower ice cream and rhubarb purée
7- caramel mousse, salted caramel - cider
The most surprising course the Tobot which was perfectly prepared - flaky and very moist. The food was out of this world! The Vergano Vermouth was superb and was a surprise to myself and my husband - delightful.
If I could give a higher star rating I would.

Good but not extraordinary.,Raymond P,0,2015-05-26,"Given the hype and the long wait to book a table, there are expectations. Let me be clear .. a 3 course lunch menu for Euro 30 is more than correct with a wine list that is extensive and also correctly priced. The staff ( more than 12 that I could count) were pleasant and the service good if a bit impersonal since different people did different things. So on that score Septime is good and good value for money. What it isn't, is extraordinary. All the dishes are very well presented and technically cooked to perfection. But after two mouthfuls there is just the same taste and tone throughout the dish. There is no variation or surprise so it becomes, frankly, a bit boring and unsatisfying. In short, technique has precedence over the 'wow factor and 3 weeks is too long to wait for that.",2015-05-01,0,4,Tuesday,May
Overrated,Fauvel,0,2015-05-26,"Given how laborious it was to get a table here (many, many phone calls were needed to catch a human being--the online system didn't work for me), I had high expectations. I found Septime to be very good but really not excellent. I am a big foodie and love strange flavor combinations but many of the dishes just didn't work (e.g. strawberries in a sweetened pee puree as one of the dessert courses). All in all, it was a perfectly pleasant experience but nothing extraordinary and certainly not worth all of the work of getting a reservation. The highlight was actually the service. The waiters are all attentive without being snobby or cold. The people working at the bar also knew their wines backwards and forwards.",2015-05-01,5,3,Tuesday,May
"Strong start, questionable end",Sylvie07,0,2015-05-25,"Our reservation was for 8:00 pm and we were seated immediately. The only option at Septime was the seven course chef’s menu for 65 Euro per person. In summary, we felt there were great entrees, good main, good service, ending with a strange ""transition"" dessert.

For the entrees, the zucchini with lightly cooked rhubarb was served with soft goat cheese under it, and was good. The soup dish, my personal favorite, was exquisite, with green beans presented in a bowl with some herbs (mint and chives, for example) that the server then covered with a tasty light fish broth that had been infused with herbs. The white asparagus and fish course was delightful. My one complaint regarding the mains was that the chicken was rather rubbery, but tasted good.

As for drinks, I had a glass of rosé that grew on me, followed later by a glass of Chablis that was lovely. My husband enjoyed his Deck-Donahue Beaupres Spring Pale made in Montreuil. Be aware that the small bottle of (eco?) tap water costs 4.5 Euro which we felt was excessive.

The servers patiently explained components of the various dishes, often trying in English, although at times, the code-switching made it more difficult than if they had consistently used French. (I speak French and my husband is learning.) One issue, no matter which language, is that we had probably 6 different servers throughout the evening, which made service seem disorganized.

The meal seemed to start strongly but we were truly disappointed when the first dessert-y course was brought to the table. Here is the excerpt of our conversation at that point:
The server, placing plates on our table: C’est une mousse aux petits pois avec des fraises et des petites pousses de petits pois.
R: Did she just say peas?
Me: She did…

This, to say the least, was a strange dish. The pea mousse was sweetened and came with sweet strawberries. I wanted to love it! Although the color combination was quite nice, I kept hoping the aftertaste of peas would leave my mouth. It wasn’t pleasant. David Lebovitz, if you are listening, please explain! Help me understand! We engaged one of the servers in a conversation about this dish, still doubting that peas were implicated in a dessert. She confirmed it and explained that it was meant to serve as a transition from the last main dish to the sweeter boule of ice cream at the end. J’aurais pu m’en passer, merci! But overall, the experience at Septime was good (better than average, for sure).

Attendez, one last comment: the noise level is difficult, due to terrible acoustics with the cement walls. We suggest adding some acoustic tile to ameliorate this.",2015-05-01,0,4,Monday,May
Feeling abused,kkovach,0,2015-05-18,"A party of 6 of us, all friends from the states, decided to have our final dinner at Septime. In our opinion, this is the most overrated restaurant in Paris. It was an hour after sitting down that we had our first course...an unmemorable lump of chevre with slices of raw zucchini on top. This awful course was topped by the fish course of a white fish in a thick, heavy white sauce with no flavor topped with sliced white radishes. Oh, did I mention that this was served on a white plate? The only course that was decent was the steak tartar. The service between courses was appalling with no explanation. If you enjoy paying a fortune for inferior service and inedible food this is the place for you.",2015-05-01,6,1,Monday,May

A relaxing atmosphere with some fine food,Arielle Fu Hua Y,0,2015-05-16,"After my meal here, I booked Septime right away for two weeks later!
First time here I had the 30 euro lunch menu and was amazed at how good the food was! Although made with simple, every-day ingredients, there is much skill to the food preparation, added with a bit of creativity.
My second time here, only their ""carte blanche"" offer was available: 6 dishes for 60 euros. Everything up until the 2 desserts was great. For dessert, it was ice cream with baked granola, and strawberries with fresh cream. Not too impressive at all--which is why i only gave it 4 stars. I wish they had a better ending to the entire meal as the entrees and mains were great.
Either way, still very very good value meal!

Good food but may not worth the hassle,Hsiao-Hui W,0,2015-05-16,"This place, if book online, needs to be book exactly 3 weeks ahead, not a day early, not a day late. We went on a raining hoiday for lunch and the place was packed. Since it was a holiday, so for lunch only tasting menu available, 60 euros for 6 courses. The first two entrees were not bad, slices of zucchini with some cheese and beef carpaccio. Two mains were white asparagus with fish and quail, both cooked deliciously. Two desserts were kind of diapointment, I dont feel that the chef put much thoughts into deserts as the previous dishes. Overall, it was a good eat but may not worth the troubles of booking three weeks in advance.",2015-05-01,0,3,Saturday,May

"Delicious food, impeccable service, and rustic chic décor!",Joobert,0,2015-05-02,"We arrived at Septime hungry for lunch, and with high hopes after reading so many good reviews. First and foremost, the service was fantastic. The waiters were attentive without being overbearing. They took their time to explain each menu item. The presentation and portion size were on point. So what about the food? It was delicious! The meals were well balanced and flavourful. Finally, the décor was rustic, yet chic. The small details such as using an indie gin bottle as a water carafe, Aesop brand hand soap in the restroom, and the antique mirrors mixed with distressed wood tables, really made the atmosphere so homey and cozy.

Hugely underrated. Superb,travelaussiefamily,0,2015-04-08,"Septime is hard to get into. We booked by calling in the middle of the night from Australia weeks in advance. It was well worth it! The food is divine. We enjoyed the 6 course degustation lunch. The flavours were superb. Service was first class. There were a lot of waiters but at no time did we feel over serviced or scrutinised. It all fell into the background, yet if ever we needed anything someone was right there. The staff were very observant that our two daughters each didn't like one of the degustation courses and they with no fuss whisked them away and brought an alternatives which in both cases was delightful. The ambience of the restaurant is very relaxed so no need to be dressed beyond smart casual. ",2015-04-08,1,4,Wednesday,April

Incredible,TheMcGonigals,0,2015-02-26,"What's not to like about Septime? It's one of Paris' newest Michelin starred restaurants, it serves incredible food and the prices are extremely reasonable!

The Septime concept is simple - the menu is a surprise - the only thing your server asks is if you've any allergies or strong dislikes. After that you're in for 7 courses of surprises.....

A word of warning though, Septime is ALWAYS fully booked, make sure you call 3 weeks in advance and be persistent - it's well worth the effort!",2015-02-26,3,5,Thursday,February
Had a nice time,nouglytourist,0,2015-02-18,"Passed by this restaurant a few times and noticed that it is always packed. Many trendy restaurants have opened up in the past few years in the 11th arrondissement.

Like the modern decor. The heaters running up the length of the columns are very original. The lighting is just right: not too dark nor too bright.

We had the tasting menu (Carte Blanche Soir) for €65 per person.

The server who took our order (man with a hipster red, bushy beard and bad attitude) told us in rude tone when we asked what the dishes would be: I can't tell you now. Then, he walked away. Uh, no, we didn't expect him to go into detail right then and there about each and every dish we'd be served but he could have given us some indication of what we'd be eating (i.e. seafood, red meat, etc.) instead of responding so curtly. The other servers were polite and took the time to explain the dishes to us. They also didn't hestitate to ensure that our bread basket was filled. The bread, btw, is from Maison Landemaine and is wonderful.

A lot of work went into preparing and presenting each dish and their efforts were not wasted on us. We appreciated the blend of different flavours and textures. They offered us an appetiser of deep fried brussel sprouts served with a creamy sesame seed sauce. Cannot remember all of the dishes but can tell you that the highlights were: the bok choy with hake (delicious) in a rich sauce and the pan fried Jerusalem artichokes (topinambour) with grated ricotta (equally delicious). The only dish I didn't like was one with squid and fennel in a lemon sauce because it was a tad too sour. Also the chicken they served (poularde) was dry and difficult to cut.

You can have cheese for an extra €9. We opted for two desserts. We liked the first one with citrus fruits topped with whipped cream but could have gone without the second dessert of apple sauce with caramel.

When I made the reservation they told us that we had our table from 7:30 to 9:30 pm as they have a second service at 9:30 pm. We arrived on time and left at 9:35 pm. They did not rush us at all. We saw the table next to ours cleared and they seated people for the second service right away.

Dinner for two with a glass of wine and sparkling water was about €150.

Reserve at least a month in advance. They confirm your reservation the day before.",2015-02-01,0,4,Wednesday,February

A new wave of Michelin stars,Loulwa_Kaloyeros,0,2015-01-18,"We went for lunch and it is incredible value at 30$. As we were two we ordered all that was on the menu that day and nothing to regret. Everything was exquisitely cooked and presented. We had oysters in a mushroom broth and roasted heliantis with mushrooms and a cheese dressing for starters. Followed by squid in an orange sauce with sea urchins and a poultry dish. Followed by a cheese platter - enough for two and the most exquisite finale to our meal, the grilled Sicily clementine with covered in a thin layer of caramelized sugar with a sorbet and fromage frais.

Every dishes felt like it was great ingredients simply placed on a plate but something was missing to bring everything together as one dish.

Although there is no doubt that there are skilled people in kitchen, the overal gustative experience was pretty boring and not worth the cost in my opinion.",2014-06-01,2,3,Thursday,December
Eel. I love eel so much.,JennaPrice,0,2014-12-18,Hard to get good eel unless you want Japanese. Here it's in a soup with pear and cabbage and each flavour separate but working well together.

An interesting experience,flame1982uk,0,2014-12-03,"We had heard great things about Septime. And there's no doubt flashes of brilliance were evident...the steak tartare at the beginning of the meal was outstanding. As was the delicious bread and warmth and passion of the staff. But of the 7 course set menu we really only enjoyed 2 of the courses. Maybe just our personal taste, but a broth with foie gras didn't deliver, the foie gras chunks delivering an unpleasant slimy texture. Our fish dish was served extremely rare...we enjoy sushi but this half way house didn't sit right. And dessert plates were average in the extreme. The wine list was also hit and miss. We placed ourselves in the hands of the sommelier who made some strange and rather polarising choices. We felt the focus was too heavily weighted on 'organic' and 'natural' rather than simply what tastes delicious. ",2014-12-03,0,3,Wednesday,December
Nice but overrated,Zabapolka,0,2014-11-18,"Second time in this restaurant after a year of absence unfortunatelly disapointed. Warm atmosphere and friendly service, but food very basic.

It was the best I've had in Paris in a week of having duck served different ways. The restaurant was full, and that's a good sign of an excellent restaurant.

I very much enjoyed the entire experience - food, wine, ambience, and expertise of the server. One additional hint: the restaurant does not have a fully stocked bar, so don't have high expectations that you'll have a good vodka there.",2014-11-01,1,5,Thursday,November

"Maybe it was us, not them",butch14nj,0,2014-10-14,"Our lunch at Septime two years ago was fabulous........5 star. This time we booked for dinner. On this night there was no menu to select from because it was ""a special seven course surprise menu"". No choices just give us what you are allergic to or just don't like. I guess our list was not long enough. We started off with raw sea bass and a dish of raw veal( I don't eat raw fish but I never told them I also don't eat raw meat. Next came a lettuce salad with cheese for me and with a seafood foam for my wife.......just fair. Next was a watercress soup with large oyster which would have been great but the soup was quite bitter. Next was a dish of grilled cuttlefish (squid) which neither of us really eat. Same for the next course, lightly cooked sweetbreads. Fortunately, dessert was very good as was the bread. With wine by the glass, the meal was 150 euros.
So the title maybe it was us, not them is the only thing I can attribute the rating to.

Excellent value for money with great food and attitude,CBRfinediners,54,2014-09-17,We ate a 3 course menu for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it as did all other iners around us. Exceptional lunchtime menu at E30 p/p. really pleasant service.,2014-09-01,0,5,Wednesday,September
Definitely one of the best in Paris!,iashi,0,2014-09-15,"Had dinner twice at Septime and both times, the food was excellent. Different menus but we could taste the consistency and flavours that have made this restaurant popular. Additionally, service was great as the waiters tried their best to speak in a second language. Price-wise, we thoguht it was reasonably priced. Wine selection is very good too.",2014-07-01,1,5,Monday,September
A faultless experience,Gavin J,0,2014-09-09,"We were incredibly lucky to get a table at this wonderful restaurant. Our french is poor but every single member of staff was accommodating and spoke perfect English to us. The decor is understated and subtle and the atmosphere was bustling and intimate. We ate at lunch time and decided to go for he 3 course set meal, with the best charcuterie and bread I've ever had to start. I think septime is the perfect restaurant because the set prices act as a total leveller making fine dining open to anyone! While waiting for our food we had some damn fine gin and tonics, made with monkey reserve gin. Too good! Every bit of food was a sensory revelation, it's a very small menu and so there is no weak link, I feel like I could have ordered anything and it would have been spectacular! I will recccomemd to EVERYONE!",2014-09-01,5,5,Tuesday,September
Great Find,cyt2014,0,2014-09-03,"Had lunch here on our first day in Paris. We were actually heading to another restaurant, but had heard of Septime in our research for our trip and decided to eat there. We were not disappointed. The wait staff was very attentive, and helped us with our wine selection. The food was incredible. We did the 3 course prix fixe lunch and were not disappointed. We would definitely eat here again

overrated and overpriced,Unparisian,0,2014-07-23,"It was quite tough to get a reservation (probably a strategy to make the place more sought-after); the restaurant even called beforehand to make sure that we really intended to go. Four of us went for lunch on a summer week day: the restaurant isn't big, tables are close together, and it's unpleasantly noisy -- especially with the windows open for air as the street is narrow and very busy with traffic, including big trucks. As a result it was difficult to have a conversation between four people at a relatively small table. Decoration is predictably trendy, stylishly simple but pleasant. Table tops are made of thick rough wood; chairs are uncomfortably hard. The place feels a little hectic, in the dining room as well as in the cramped kitchen which is visible from the tables. The (more or less English-speaking) French staff looks young and smart. There is a €28 lunch menu, but since 2 of us wanted the ""Carte Blanche"" menu at €55 (without drinks), the waitress declared we all had to have the same kind of menu for (their) convenience and meal timing... Okay, so be it, we all went for the ""Carte Blanche"". That means a surprise five-course meal that the chef decides on. One of us was a vegetarian and they said that was no problem; they would make special dishes. However it's not the best place for a veggie: all they did in fact was remove the meat or fish around the very few veggies on the plate. No replacement with tofu, grains, pasta or any others such foods. So, since all of the portions are very small to begin with, the veggie meal was minimal and insufficient (fortunately the bread was good). The wine recommended by the waiter was fine. On the whole, ingredients were tasty and fresh (but skimpy), the food was all right but not very exciting or outstanding, despite an attempt to be somewhat different and original (perhaps that's the problem?). The place and the meal were not exceptional in any way despite a Michelin *. It was below our expectation after reading all the good reviews and it felt overrated and overpriced considering the quality and the small quantity (about €70 per person with drinks). I would not particularly recommend eating there over any other restaurant with decent reviews; in fact I would hesitate to go there for a relaxing dinner because of the the lack of comfort, and the busy and noisy environment.",2014-07-01,5,3,Wednesday,July
allows cell phones,729SSS1970,0,2014-07-21,"We were able to get a reservation three weeks in advance and we would have enjoyed our meal, but as you may know, tables are small and close together in Paris and the couple next to us were on their cell phones the entire time we were there. We mentioned to our server and he just looked at us like we were nuts and not with it!!!! Will not go back. If you wish to go be prepared to deal with cell phone talkers.",2014-05-01,1,2,Monday,July
Very ambitious. Maybe too.much so.,unloved,0,2014-07-12,"For several weeks before our recent trip to Paris, we attempted to make a reservation at this one Michelin star restaurant. Would you like a table at 9:39 on the third Sunday of the year 2016? How hot can a restaurant be? We eventually gave up. Well, lo and behold, there was a last minute cancellation and we were given the opportunity to experience the ""emperor's new clothes"" version of a restaurant. Located way out of the way from anywhere convenient, the place has a decor reminiscent of the bunker on LOST. Ironically, after the ordeal of making a reservation, not all of the tables were filled.
There is no menu. Your server will attempt to describe, in English, what the chef has prepared. So, it can be a bit of a crap shoot knowing what you're actually eating.. The menu is nothing, if not creative. Raw veal, that's right, raw veal, in tomato water and several mystery ingredients that all tasted fresh but added up to a fairly un exciting and potentially dangerous dish. Following that, was a small chunk of monkfish in some other kind of vegetable water. Clearly sauce as we know it, is dead. Viva water! Again, clean favours, bland dish. No individual flavour jumped out. If you've ever shared an imaginary tea with a five year old girl, you'll understand how I felt when the meal was finally over. It was very imaginative but it I didn't really get tea. (By the way, there are at least five other courses, so by the third course I became jealous of diners who were paying their checks).
There were two deserts. One a cucumber sorbet, in yet another unidentifiable water which was,
refreshing and flavourful, (the flavour being primarily cucumber). And finally, there was some kind of chocolate mouse, which had so much chocolate flavour it reminded me of what had mostly been missing from the majority of the meal. Obvious flavour. It was quite satisfying and delicious. I really wanted to like Septime. God knows it's unique, and even adventurous. I just wish it all tasted better.",2014-07-01,4,3,Saturday,July
Hype tough to understand,leloir,0,2014-07-08,Decent food for sure. Ingredients fresh. Preparation fine. But cramped tables. Uncomfortable chairs. Cold reception. Amateur service.

The downside is the really difficult booking process as well as the difficult to find place. The place is peopled by locals so that indicates good food.

Focus on Flavors in Beautifully Rustic Setting,dpdes60,0,2014-06-05,"I must admit I was a bit apprehensive of the hype. In addition, the website reservation system is useless. However, all anxiety melted upon entering the rustic and glowing dining room. We were warmly received and true concern for our enjoyment was evidenced by the wait staff's efforts to discern any food intolerances of of our party members. We chose the carte blanche menu and were treated to an array of courses which displayed creative combinations of pleasurable, often surprising flavors and textures. The recommended wine paired beautifully with the meal.
The entire experience was unpretentious and thoroughly enjoyable. We left satiated and genuinely cared for by the staff. The value is remarkable as one could easily spend much more on a mediocre meal in noisy and crowded tourist trap brasserie.",2014-05-01,4,5,Thursday,June

We had lunch, which is easier to secure. We booked through the online portal after the hotel said they couldn't get us a table!

Experience total,Dondanne79,0,2014-05-25,"I Had a recommendation to go to Septime, which I did, everything from decor, staff, food, wine is way above average.
Here is a strict line and a clear focus what Septime wants to achieve and they do.
There is one set menu at 58 Euro, which is the way You eat here.
This is the way for the chef to make sure that everything is perfectly fresh and in season.
Great innovative dishes with great balance between sweet, sour, salt, bitter and umami also the dishes are made with finesse and different textures which makes every dish exciting.

The wines they serve here is all made with healthy grapes, organic or biodynamic, some wines with a bit sulfite added and some is natural. All selected with love and passion.
Also other handpicked drinks in case You prefer other stuff than wine.

The greatest thing about Septime is the staff, I was a lone eater and was treated as well as the other guests. The buzz is really warm and loud with a lot of laughter.
The waiters & chef worked all together as one team, sharing laughs, presenting dishes and clearing plates.
The staff is all very knowledgeable and speaks very good English.

The setting is cosy, rustic with a very warm atmosphere.
You will step straight into the bar when opening the doors and the kitchen will be an open one.

Septime is all about a great experience, with a light, interesting and innovative cousine in a good atmosphere created by the great staff.

Don´t miss this one if You go to Paris!",2014-04-01,5,5,Sunday,May
brilliant,CR80,0,2014-05-22,"Eating ""carte blanche"" is always risky, as they can't always meet everyone's taste. In our case, my wife was overly happy with the menu they served on that evening, while it didn't exactly include my favourites - nevertheless, I very much appreciated its quality and creativity.
The atmosphere is relaxed, and staff is very friendly.
For 58 Euro the menu is a bargain (not only for Paris), and I will definitely try to get another reservation on my next trip to Paris.

I need to say though, that the hype seems to be a bit exaggerated. There are equally brilliant restaurants and chefs in other cities and countries, with a similar concept (modernized local cuisine, in a laid-back atmosphere), that don't make it even near any ""Best Restaurants of the World"" list - probably because they just don't happen to be placed in Paris/France.

When I commented that this was the first time this ever happened to me in France, he replied: ""Well Monsieur, it's 9:30 and you've had the table for two hours.""

"Amazing, creative food and excellent service",Mikearmo,0,2014-04-23,"Had a great dinner at Septime for my wife's birthday. I was looking forward to the meal from the moment we booked it and it didn't disappoint. The food was fantastic, each course was completely different to the last, and there were some really interesting touches along the way. I'd be very surprised if they don't get a Michelin Star soon.

They have an excellent wine list too, although a suggestion would be for the restaurant to offer wines paired with each course. As you don't know what food you will be eating until it arrives it's hard to pick a wine, and while the bottle we had was really good, it wasn't an ideal match for every course. I'm sure if we'd have asked they would have suggested different wines for us to try however, but it could be something the restaurant offer as a matter of course.

By the way if you're booking online make sure you are ready to book exactly 21 days before you want to go. We did this and had no problem getting a table.",2014-04-01,2,5,Wednesday,April

We went in with high expectations of course based on the reviews, awards and hype. We were not disappointed. We took the fixed menu for dinner (I don't think there is another choice!) and thought it was a good value for what you get.

Go for the five course taster,MattJames355,0,2014-02-14,"What a lovely little restaurant. Somehow we walked straight past it first time, but so so glad we turned round and found it. We must have come right at the start of service. We walked in to an almost empty restaurant and wondered why there was all the fuss over booking weeks in advance. Half an hour later every table was occupied with couples enjoying beautiful food.

Service was great, there was always someone on hand to see how we were getting on and each dish was explained. We were asked if we wanted to choose from the set menu (changes daily) or try the five course ""adventure"" - of course went for the more expensive, but not crazily so adventure.

After the waitress checked for allergies or dislikes (none we'll try anything), we sipped our wine and waited to see what came up. Two starters, fish, meat and either dessert or cheese. with a glass of wine and water for the table we spent €130 - not bad at all.

Starters were steak tartar (nice big portion) with beetroot and then the biggest piece of foie gras I've ever seen. Although the mains couldn't quite match this they were still superb. After a nice big bit of pollock we were wondering if we would have room for meat. What we got was sweet bread. Nice and light and a perfect accompaniment.

I wouldn't hesitate to give this my fullest recommendation. I don't think they have a michelin star yet, but it surely can't be long.

Good enough for Jay Z and Beyonce, good enough for us, and good enough for you.",2014-02-01,3,5,Friday,February

Simple but well done,Abbey S,0,2014-01-22,"Opening Remarks:
-One of the more difficult restaurants to get a reservation (book online at least 2 weeks in advance)
-Currently #49 in the World’s top 50 restaurants
-The current Head Chef is the young Bertrand Grébaut
-Located in the Ledru-Rollin area of Paris

Ambiance:
-Modern Scandanavian with wooden chairs and tables – so rustic and raw I worry my drink may topple if I don’t find a sturdy groove in the table
-It’s buzzing but not so loud I can’t hear my partner or server- actually, if this is loud for Parisians, I think they’d all go deaf after a night out in Toronto
-We were sat at a table right in front of the open kitchen where I had the pleasure of watching a number of female chefs work alongside their male counterparts. How refreshing!
-It’s casual, so really you can wear what you want, though you’ll probably want to brush your hair and put on something cute, because the servers are pretty attractive. The demographic is relatively young and hip, lots of 20-40 year old couples, and a few groups around the round tables as well.

Service:
-The service is casual, but professional. The staff all made convivial conversation (despite having to speak in English to us), made fabulous wine recommendations, and made sure our cutlery and plates were replenished in a timely manner
-The meal moved at a comfortable pace between courses and we were in and out in approximately 1 ½ hours.
-Our main server was wonderful at helping us through the menu, and all of the food runners did their absolute best to explain dishes slowly and in English
-A small problem came when one of the other servers inquired about whether we wanted a cheese course. We were on the fence as we still had two more dishes to go, so he suggested we just get one to share. We agreed to that and soon received the single cheese plate. Following that, however, we started to only get one dish to share- our pre-dessert came and there was only one, and then our main dessert came solo as well. I then asked someone why we were only getting one dish to share when others got one each. Apparently, they misunderstood my request for one add-on cheese course as us now wanting only one dish to share going forward. They offered to bring us the missing two, but we were not going to make a fuss, and in compensation, they comped us the add on cheese.

Drink Menu:
-Wine options are given on a metal slate clipboard and there are far too many pages to flip through
-There is a page worth of wines by the glass and the rest are all sold in bottles – no demis available here
-We start with a recommended bubbly and then at the recommendation of our knowledgeable server, share a bottle of the 2012 La Begou- considering the two of us have very different taste in wine and yet both loved it to bits. Incredibly smooth, well rounded and easy to drink with food.

Food Menu:
-I am not sure if there is usually an a la carte option but on our visit it was strictly Carte Blanche for €58 and the option to add a cheese course for €8 per person
-The food on our visit was light, refreshing and colourful, with a focus on in-season fruits and vegetables
-Presentation is very simple and to the point- it allows the integrity of the lovely ingredients to truly shine

Tomato, Red Tuna Sashimi, Sliced Turnip and Coriander

Sweet and succulent ripe heirloom tomato with deliciously fatty tuna. A refreshing start to the meal.

Roasted Eggplant with Wild Mushrooms, Basque Jambon, Pickles, Figs, Nuts & Parsely Paste

A nicely balanced dish- bitter eggplant, salty ham, briny pickles, and sweet figs with a fabulous crunch from the nuts. Light and invigorating.

Cod with the Oil from Grape Seeds, Italian White Ham, Fresh Beans with a Potato & Ham Broth

While I cannot recall the variety of the beans, they had an unmistakable vegetal flavour which was very pleasant with the salty warm broth. The fish, while very simple, was ever so gently cooked, and merely melted on the tongue.

Guinea Fowl with Fried Guinea Fowl Egg, White Beans, Artichokes and Seaweed

Even when fatty meat and fried eggs are involved, the dishes at Septime feel virtuous. The skin on the fowl was beautifully crispy and just screamed for a bath in dreamy egg yolk. My only criticism here would be that I found some of the fresh herbs and greenery on the plate a bit too dry and tough to eat.

Cautal and St. Nectaire Cheese

An added course to the Carte Blanche meal, the cautal has a flavour somewhat like aged cheddar, but with a more rubbery like texture. I much preferred the St. Nectaire which had a mild mushroomy flavour and a satin like texture. Lovely on their crusty bread.

Apricot Sorbet with Vanilla Ricotta Mousse

A mildly sweet sorbet that paired beautifully with the aromatic fluffy mousse. It was a shame we only got one!

Rhubarb Compote with Red Fruit Sorbet, Shortbread & Sour Cream

In contrast with the pre-dessert, this one had a much more intense flavour profile. The rhubarb was tangy and bright, and the sorbet was gorgeously sweet. Absolutely scrumptious, I could have licked the bowl.

Closing Remarks:
-For two Carte Blanche with a comped shared cheese course (because of the misunderstanding over the dessert portions), as well as 2 glasses of sparkling and a bottle of wine, the bill came to €178 ($245 Canadian). Not cheap, no, but quite reasonable for a tasting menu and more than a full bottle of wine.
-The meal as a whole was quite refreshing and the service (despite the miscommunication), was exactly what I was craving.
-Assuming I could get a reservation, if I lived in Paris, this is the kind of place I would probably frequent often- perfect for continuing to fit into my pants while simultaneously feeling indulged",2013-09-01,6,4,Wednesday,January
First night in Paris and we hit the bulls-eye.,Eli B,0,2014-01-12,"Now this is my style of eats in a setting redolent with warmth and modernity, and uncompromising table service and pricing. if you are obsessing over pedigreed ingredients on small plates and love rustic-urban surroundings with food lovers...than you have struck gold.
We tried the 55 euro carte blanche menu as our first- night- in- Paris treat . the veal au lait with salty trout eggs did it for me,while Madame went ape over tender pan-seared squid drizzled in peppery oil. Then the big-hitter arrived..... slow cooked pork with cabbage and anchovy cream. Absolute magic.

Go With An Open Mind,Nefelokokigia,0,2013-11-27,"The room is completely spare, with off white walls, second hand store furnishings, and a young and hip waitstaff. The tables are well placed for a touch of privacy (at least compared to most Paris restaurants). It is very difficult getting a reservation here, so call two months in advance. That being said, when we arrived at 7:30, the place was nearly empty. We were sat at the only two bar seats, and I asked if we could have a table, and they said no, they were all reserved. A half dozen couples walked in looking for a table, and were all turned away. They seem to want to take things at their own pace. The place did fill up eventually. The wine list is small, but with very good producers; all organic. The menu is Chef's Choice, though they do ask for allergies and foods that you just don't like. There are two apps, a fish, a meat, a pre desert, and a desert. All the dishes were excellent, balanced, flavorful, and healthy. All very clean, not oily. The service is relaxed and efficient, though we did need to remind them each time were were finished with our courses, and ask them to clear. Also, you must keep your knife and fork for the duration of the meal, and must just lay them on top of the table, which seemed a bit too relaxed for us. Definitely worth the effort to dine here.",2013-11-01,1,4,Wednesday,November
Just go with the flow,antriaboutiquelodge,0,2013-11-14,"We worked hard to get a table at Septime in the end getting a local to book for us but it was worth it. You have the Chef choice menu so great to be taken out of your comfort zone as you have no control over what you may get. We asked for matching wine which was a great thing to do as again the wine was not always what you may have chosen. This was our last night in France after 5 weeks so a great end to a great trip/adventure.
It was hard to get a table but do anything you can to get one as it is a great experience and one we will repeat when we return to Paris.
Go with an open mind an you will have a great experience.",2013-10-01,1,5,Thursday,November
Lovely place for lunch,kateoz,0,2013-11-11,"I tried for weeks before my trip to make a lunch reservation, but wasn't successful. Turning up on a Wednesday at 12.15pm, I was offered one of the two seats at the bar. (That's not two available seats; there are ONLY two seats at the bar.) Happily accepted it and saw many people without reservations be turned away.
The service is very, very good and particularly friendly for Paris. I speak French but noticed all the staff spoke English. The diners were mixed between visiting tourists and locals. The decor is a little rustic/modern, quite casual.
You are offered the choice of a three course menu or chef's menu of 5 courses. I chose the 3 courses and ate veal tartare with beets; fish with olives, chickpeas and zucchini; and a pear crumble that was served as poached pear, homemade vanilla ice cream and crumble pieces at the bottom of the dish. All ingredients were super fresh and delicious. Very good flavors combined.
There isn't a full bar, but they offer their own take on a G&T as a cocktail. It was deliciously fresh. All up, including the G&T, a glass of wine, food and coffee, the bill came to 42 Euro, which I thought was extremely good value.
I would highly recommend.",2013-10-01,0,4,Monday,November
HIGE EXPECTATIONS,JNBCPT,0,2013-11-01,"After reading many of the reviews here and recommendations on other websites, we decided to celebrate a special occasion in this restaurant.

Reserving a table was not easy . We therefore tried another approach and just stepped in. Staff was very welcoming and tried very hard to accommodate us. eventually, we got a table for dinner.

The restaurant decor is fairly basic but very stylish.
Service is impecable.
Atmosphere was quite formal.

We opt for the 58 euro surprise menu (two starers, main - fish, main - meat, and dessert) which was interesting.
First two dishes (starters) were fantastic. Mains were good, desert was fine.

We expected more, both in food and in atmosphere, perhaps had to high of expectations.",2013-10-01,0,3,Friday,November
"Quirky, but not at all bad",Tony R,0,2013-10-31,"Septime is really a very nice restaurant that serves meals that are a little out of the ordinary. Located on a busy street, the restaurant features tables constructed from old wood taken from railway carriages - there's no danger that anything will harm these tables! The menu is limited and features just a few choices of starters, mains, and desserts. Alternatively, you can ask the chef to prepare a meal for you - but everyone at the table has to eat the same dishes. Everything we had was very good with particular favorites being a chestnut, mushroom, and cheese starter followed by slow-roasted belly of pork. A new twist on apple crumble where the crumble is on the bottom topped with apple puree and some excellent ice cream completed the meal. Definitely worth trying - if you can get a table.",2013-10-01,1,5,Thursday,October
Delicious and interesting food,Rhonda B,21,2013-10-23,"You have to be quick off the mark to get a booking at Septime 3 weeks in advance, but is worth the effort.

A house divided,pen1,0,2013-10-02,"I agree with Mark Bitman on one point about Septime. The food preparation and technique are excellent. Beyond that my wife agrees with Bitman in terms of the food. She would rate it 5 stars. I rate it three. My basic problem is I did not like anything on the fixed price lunch menu -content, taste. My wife on the other hand enjoyed her meal immensely. Her first course was a beet and fig salad, her main was skate wing with potatoes. Both of us had the desert of the day a compote of backed fig, raspberries and a dollar of herb infused ice cream. My first course was a whie fish civic he in celery broth with thin cucumber slices. My main was pork belly served with baby turnips.
She gives it a five, I give it a three. You'll likely need a reservation for lunch and certainly for dinner",2013-10-01,2,4,Wednesday,October

A real gastronomic trip,ThMoC,0,2013-09-14,"Septime is this year's restaurant with ""buzz."" Another highly regarded young chef abandoned the star route of sous chef waiting patiently for the top job to strike out on his own away from the expensive center of town. Consequently, the ambiance, while interesting, is simple and plain. The emphasis is all on the food - which is a very good thing. The large team of chefs work busily in the open kitchen. They create interesting, very complex (sometimes overly so) dishes. The five course dinner changes daily. It's the same for all, except you are asked about allergies and food dislikes. The young staff is enthusiastic and engaging. They explain every dish in full detail, but there are so many moving parts it can be difficult to completely decrypt them. Still, most are both interesting and delicious. An example: Dessert (after the pre-dessert) was cucumber sorbet with raspberries and blackberries with a thin meringue containing black pepper flakes all in a rhubarb sauce. One is served a great deal of food, so go hungry.",2013-09-01,1,5,Saturday,September
Lives up to the hype,rachelnyc60763,0,2013-09-11,"This place is perpetually booked so reserve a few weeks in advance, it is well worth it. The menu changes daily and ingredients were all very fresh and seasonal. I had the tasting menu and everything from the perfectly prepared tuna to the crisp pork belly to the strawberry rhubarb dessert was delicious. I found the service to be excellent and appreciated the efforts to explain each course in detail in English (since my French is not great).",2013-05-01,1,5,Wednesday,September
Simple french cooking at its best,HappyFeet25,0,2013-09-08,"I had the 3 course lunch for €28. Best value for money meal in Paris. I had a starter of white beans cooked with lard and served with slivers of raw octopus n crunchy seaweed. The taste was really light but beautifully cooked. The salty seaweed which burst in my mouth provides a nice surprise. For the main I had roast pork belly with a side of small salad. The pork was done very nicely n was still pink but it was thoroughly cooked, maintaining its moisture and leaving it tender. We know how pork can get dry if overcooked but this was not the case here. Again the cooking was simple but executed with excellence resulting in a sublime dish. Dessert was poached figs served with some shortbread crumble n a salty ice cream. This was so unlike the usual french dessert n again it was very enjoyable. Overall I like Septime alot as they use top grade ingredients, employ simple but well executed cooking methods to bring out the best flavours of each and every seasonal ingredients which the chef uses. It is definitely worth making the effort to get a reservation. By the way, sevice was friendly, deco was modern n airy and location is pretty convenient and handy for those who use the metro.",2013-08-01,0,4,Sunday,September
Fantastic meal,H3117SXmikes,5,2013-09-03,We loves the surprises that the chef brought us. The food was delicious and plenty of it. The sorbets were the best! The fish soup was incredible.,2013-09-03,0,5,Tuesday,September
Well worth it.,NancyB38,0,2013-08-05,"We were lucky enough to get a Friday lunch reservation at Septime (seriously, this involved calculating what day the Friday slots would come open and then pouncing on the on-line reservation site the minute that happened). We arrived at 1:30 to discover that the small spot was still full of the diners with earlier reservations, but we hung out at the bar and the wait was only 15 minutes or so. The service was friendly and efficient, with our waiter making excellent suggestions to go with the meal. The turbot cerviche, asparagus, and roast chicken were all excellent. It was rhubarb season, so the rhubarb compote was obligatory if a bit unadventurous, though the herb ice cream with it was yummy. All in all, our best meal in Paris this trip.
On the way out we saw the staff sitting with a wine supplier, tasting his latest offerings, which was a nice ""behind the scenes"" glimpse of the restaurant world.",2013-06-01,0,5,Monday,August
Essential (if you can get a reservation),neilbontoft,0,2013-07-30,"I've had foods of all shapes and standards and Septime is definitely up there with one of the best meals I've had. From arrival I felt relaxed and at home. I was sat with a great view of the kitchen and could see the brigade hard at work. As you will know they are offer a menu with only a tasting option and I was asked if I had allergies and then the fun began. Each course was a work of art and tasted as good as it looked. The service was faultless and well oiled. This was a thoroughly amazing experience and recommended very very highly, so much so that even purchased Bertrand Grébaut's book as a lasting memory",2013-07-01,0,5,Tuesday,July
"Very good, not quite great",rumtytum,0,2013-07-21,"Septime came toweringly recommended, almost impossible to get into. The reality is good, but not what the hype led us to expect. Quite simple food, nicely presented, expertly cooked. In a world that extends from McDonalds' sugary rubbish all the way to bistro predictability it's nice to have a meal that's pure class, served by charming people who believe in the excellence of the food that's coming out of the kitchen. The sommelier was expert, recommended a brilliant white grenache. We had a good time, but I don't think you should expect to be blown away. More reassured that it's possible to eat very well indeed without paying the earth.",2013-06-01,0,4,Sunday,July
Amazing tasting menu in the 11th,bccorb,0,2013-07-17,"I found out about this place from an article in the New York Times so always worry that will cause restaurant to be overrun with other tourists and/or have gone downhill due to that overrun. I need not have worried as though there were other tourist including a couple from Australia sitting next to us the out of way location(in the 11th) have kept both of those from happening.

The food was amazing as though there is no menu they do take allergies and preferences into account. My girlfriend does not like raw food so they nicely seared the tuna for the first course and added some whole tomatoes to freshen up the dish that it would not get from the citrus in the raw fish. Service was amazing as they tried to look up what the English word for one of the fish they were serving(it ended up being Whiting which is merlan in French). The desserts were good but kind of throw aways in comparison to the amazing food during the first four courses as got two different type of ice cream with some extra thown in.

When I return to Paris I will have to decide whether to come here or to Pierre Sang's first. Since this place does take reservations will likely have that be my decision maker.

One last feature I liked is that it has a proper bar so can get a drink inside while wait for table. Most of the restaurants in Paris I went to one had to just sit out in the street with your drink.",2013-07-01,1,5,Wednesday,July
delightful lunch,LittleHunter,0,2013-06-26,"We booked in advance and had a wonderful lunch here today. If you're going with someone who doesn't mind giving you a taste of their food and vice versa, then I recommend the 3 course prix-fixe as opposed to the 5 courses where you get no choice and the kitchen surprises you. The reason is this: my boyfriend and I got the 3 courses and we observed that everyone around us who got the 5 got the exact same dishes as us - no ""surprises."" Just MORE of what we had already tasted, having each chosen different options in the set menu. Just a tip. The service is efficient and friendly, though it's more on the efficient side since Septime is such a destination now. Don't miss looking at the wonderful garden in the back.",2013-06-01,1,4,Wednesday,June
15th wedding anniversary meal,Stephen W,0,2013-06-24,"My goal was to invite my French wife to this neighbourhood hotspot on the 13th of June, our anniversary date, for dinner. This being a very tough table to reserve we had to settle for lunch on the 18th. That was the only negative part of the experience.

Septime takes simple ingredients and presents them in a beautiful and amazingly tasteful way. The menu the day we ate lunch was Summer-light and undeniably delicious. The service was excellent without being cloying and the décor of this restaurant is gorgeously understated. Do not miss a peek out the back door on the way to the washroom to see a beautifully designed green garden in the back yard. A reasonably priced lunch (for Paris) when you consider the quality of the food and service! Highly recommended! We will return.",2013-06-01,1,5,Monday,June
Just the kind of food you like to eat and just the type of restaurant you like to eat in,pcouture29,0,2013-06-20,"Despite now being rated one of the best restaurants in the world Septime is an easy going place where you do not need to dress especially well. I recommend dressing your usual stylish way and you'll be okay. Reservations are made on the website and I did not find it difficult to book. Just keep checking, though not obsessively. The restaurant is always full and you're going to be close to other customers but not packed too tight. Service spoke English well enough and they were professional, timel, and make you feel welcome. The wine is affordable and seems well considered, and the fixed price menu (mandatory, changes daily) is a fair value given the quality of the food and preparation. This is food to savor. A fresh wide variety of premier ingredients with deep tastes. Nothing especially fancy but certainly not boring bistro, and that's good and expected in a setting like this, which could be in Brooklyn or Chicago's west loop. With that said, the plates are better than at comparably priced restaurants except possibly Bones. My only caveats were that the vegetables were sometimes on the salty side, the lamb was not convincing, and the espresso I recommend staying away from entirely. (Disclaimer: I do not like lamb but thought Bertrand Grébaut might convince me of my error.) Otherwise, and there was a lot of otherwise, this was an enjoyable experience and the kind of restaurant you wish was in your neighborhood. You leave feeling good. Simple as that.",2013-06-01,1,4,Thursday,June
A Hot New Restaurant,mjmack08,0,2013-06-08,"We have just discovered Septime, and (if we can ever manage to get reservations again) intend to return. Very popular--so much so that many simply have given up on getting dinner reservations and go for lunch, which is also a great option, depending on your schedule. A little more expensive than what we usually pay for dinner (55 Euros for a 5-course menu), but worth every centime. Exciting food, attentive service. This is a chef, and restaurant, worth watching.",2013-05-01,1,5,Saturday,June
Excellent atmosphere and cuisine,Cheryl094,0,2013-06-06,"Septime doesn't look like anything special from the outside, but inside is quite tastefully decorated and is a nice change from other restaurants of its caliber. We waited three weeks for a lunch reservation but once there, we enjoyed the entire experience and the pricing is extremely reasonable for what you have. Original wine lists, nice presentation and flavors, attentive staff and relaxed atmosphere. Wonderful choices at lunch that suit those who are either adventurous or conservative with food. There is nothing quite like it in Paris.",2013-05-01,0,5,Thursday,June
Absolutely amazing lunch,DCMundo,0,2013-06-04,"My partner and I were very fortunate when a fellow guest at our hotel offered us a reservation at Septime they had made a month in advance, but could not use because of other commitments. This was one of the top two meals in a week of outstanding wining and dining in Paris. The interior is simple and almost rustic, but elegant. The staff are very friendly and more attentive than average for France. They explain and describe each dish as it's presented, but in a subtle and non-intrusive way. The entree, white asparagus with caviar and wild flowers, was one of the single best dishes I ever ate. The menu formule was very reasonable for three courses and the waiter suggested the perfect wine pairings by the glass (also inexpensive).",2013-05-01,1,5,Tuesday,June
Our great lazy lunch in Paris,Travel_Addicts97,0,2013-05-30,"We reserved our table 4 weeks in advance and had high hopes for our lunch at Septime....we weren't disappointed. From the moment we arrived, staff were friendly and happy to help despite our limited French (staff explained/described everything in English). We chose the three course set menu and found each dish delicious, fresh and well presented. The waiter also recommended various wines for us for each course and all were excellent. At €28 for 3 courses the meal was very cheap for the quality, albeit by the time we had 4 wines each the bill was around €110. All up, we had a fantastic experience at Septime and would return without hesitation next time we are in Paris.",2013-05-01,1,5,Thursday,May

Pleasant but didn't meet expectations,kykismet,0,2013-05-25,"I think the food writers have to be careful and not hype a place too much. We had a pleasant meal there and the staff was good. Overall an above-average experience. However, since we had heard such rave about the food, etc. we had high expectations which were not quite met. The food was beautifully presented but tends to be on the bland side. The fish and the chicken were just barely done; I am assuming that was intentional. The salmon tartare with chèvre was a winner. I think the restaurant was still worth trying.",2013-05-01,2,3,Saturday,May

Add a chair, again I politely said Do you have another table? ( place was empty)Finally I just pointed to a table and with his
Frustrated look ...said Oui. Our Guest arrives and we ordered each a glass of Champagne , no bubbles and warm...
I would tell you about the food but the whole ""Septime"" experience went downhill from there...From the raw tasteless veal

Everyday ingredients become high art.,buddahbaker,0,2013-01-24,"Do go here to experience trendy neo-bistro cuisine in a stark, cool room, featuring industrial lighting, cement floors, rough-hewn barn board tables and bar. At our 9 pm sitting, the full room sends the noise decibels over the top, as the sounds of happy diners and the open kitchen heighten by the minute. Service from our waiter/sommelier is remarkable throughout the entire evening. He speaks perfect English, and explains to us that we will receive a five course surprise menu. We choose a glass of champagne to start and select our own wine, rather than the wine pairing option. Not knowing what we will be eating makes ordering wine a guessing game, so he redirects our selection of a Bourgogne to a Beajolais cru.

Chef Bertrand Grébaut's cuisine is a celebration of seasonal vegetables, conceptualized and composed into small courses that satisfy all the senses. There are no luxe ingredients, in fact, very little protein, save for some lardo shavings over braised endive, an egg with parsley sauce, and main course before dessert is a slice of chicken breast, brazenly cooked rosy, with salsify and hay-smoked potato. Every course was thoughtful, creative and well executed. However, the most memorable, lasting impression was the bread ice cream served with honey caramelized apple with a rum sabayon. I was able to meet the pastry chef at the end of the evening, and she told me how she makes it. This bread ice cream was amazing - malty and creamy.

Overall, a great experience was had, but was it good value? At 55 euro per person, maybe not. I was expecting a little more, maybe some fish, or other protein. It seemed alot for mainly vegetables and chicken breast.",2012-12-01,1,4,Thursday,January

Great food but overhyped,Jesu I,0,2012-12-29,"I booked my regular three weeks ahead to get a table in this nearby restaurant and i did not regret it. The food is delicioud, dishes are original and definitely fresh. I love habing no choice with the menu. it´s prix fixed, plenty of courses and full of surprises. Cannot deny it is a few notches above regular eateries and bistros i go to. If you can get a table and want to experience real food in a beautiful west village kind of setting you should go.
However you can find simimar food without booking that far in advance, that´s why i probably won ´t go anymore.

I must say I do like to have some form of choice so it was a bit difficult for me but I was very keen to try anyway. The space is lovely. Quite buzzy but at the same time serene. We had a very charming waiter who was very helpful. I can't put my finger on it but I preferred Vivant which is often compared with it although they are actually very different. This is a bit more grown up. The food was very delicate and lots of wee surprises and nice touches.,2012-09-01,0,4,Monday,November
A light but delicious meal,Egon70,0,2012-10-30,"I was in Paris for 6 days and had eaten in Jean Francois Piege and Kei before I tried Septime. It's a nice change from the complicated menus which consisted of so many dishes that I'd in those 2 restaurants.

The dinner menu is called menu carte blanche which means you don't know what you'll actually get. But the server will ask you whether you've any food allegy.

My meal comprised of 2 entrees, 2 plats and 1 dessert. The ingredients were very fresh. All the food was light but didn't lack flavour. The service was friendly and efficient. The price was reasonable.

I'll recommend this place.",2012-10-30,0,4,Tuesday,October
A Very Special Place,JayneQ6,0,2012-10-25,"We had lunch today at Septime. I choose this resto because of the newer bistronomies, it has online reservations. It is a bit of a hike, but an absolutely DELIGHTFUL place. As previous reviewers have mentioned, the room is light and comfortable and neither loud or too crowded. We were pleased to get a corner table at the window and could see the street as well as the interior. The staff is very pleasant and helpful, most spoke good English and tolerated our attempts at French. They explained the menu well, and most importantly, accomodated our Vegetarian as well.
The food was sublime. We all agreed heartily it was one of the best meals we had in Paris and for that matter, ever. In fact, our veggie said it was the best meal she has had EVER.
My companion ordered the boudin (blood sausage) with some trepidation and it was great. The fish and duck mains were also excellent.
At 28E for three courses this place is a steal.",2012-10-01,1,5,Thursday,October
best of the best,sapporostan,0,2012-10-18,"did consecutive nights of october 2 and 3,2012 so can honestly say they change the complete menu and wine list every night.this restaurant is only for those who know food and are not out to be a name-dropper.this is a very special place that will go down as my best meal (s) i have ever eaten in my lifetime.those who find fault,as is allowed in free speech, do not know what special food is all about.there is none better anywhere.",2012-10-01,0,5,Thursday,October
Gastronomy without the pretense or price,NicaCasey,36,2012-10-17,"Incredible use of vegetables and fish in the menu the night I had the please of visiting.

Loved everything,Berrycocktail,2,2012-09-15,"The food was great, the staff was good, the interior was sophisticated, the customers were decent; and I am very glad we went. The best one we went in Paris.

Make sure you reserve in advance.

"Cool vibe, good value",markbanshee,0,2012-09-15,"Nice place, friendly, knowledgeable servers and a reasonable price for a good meal. Clearly there are tons of great places to eat in Paris, but I was very happy we took a night to eat here. Good fresh ingredients and really enjoyed some nice variety of fish. Very yummy pigeon, cooked perfectly and a nice finish to the savory portion of the meal. Similar meals with the same concept could easily go for much more money, glad these guys have kept the prices reasonable. Decent portion sizes and all of them tasty. Check it out, it will not disappoint.",2012-09-01,0,4,Saturday,September
Ubercool eatery,TommasoMilano,0,2012-09-08,"How cool is this place? super NY-vibe, young and friendly waiters, great atmosphere in the room.

Great value for money for lunch, 26€ gets you three well executed dishes, which had the only (irrelevant) problem of being a bit too much ""fashionable"", in a sense in which most paris bistronomiques are.

I want to go back, try 5 dishes for dinner with wine matching, and see if I can add one point.",2012-09-08,0,4,Saturday,September
Top Quality Ingredients - Exceptional Value,HawaiiWang,0,2012-06-16,"THis was our first time dining at Septime. We went for lunch (you must reserve). We selected the prix fix 3 course lunch menu (26 euro). My first corse was a wonderful grilled octopus followed by fish for my entree and to finish with fresh strawberries with homemade elder flower ice cream. The food was exceptional, beautifully presented and of the finest ingredients. We will definitely be back. ",2012-06-01,0,5,Saturday,June
Cuisine Serieuse,happyintoronto2,0,2012-05-18,"We had lunch at Septime today, and when we finished, we immediately made a reservation for dinner on our upcoming last night in Paris. My wife and I agreed that it was the best restaurant we have experienced since Noma in Copenhagen four years ago, and Noma is regularly reviewed as the ""best restaurant in the world."" Septime is right up there.

The lunch menu choices are limited, which is fine with us, because it means they only use the freshest ingredients available. We always share what we order, unless we happen to order the same thing. So we shared entrees of lamb sweetbreads and raw, sashimi-style mullet. Both were superb. Then we both ordered merluche (hake) and it was absolutely outstanding.

I told the waitress, ""C'est cuisine serieuse"" (this is serious cooking), and she immediately grinned and said she would tell the chef. I hope she did, because he deserves it. We strongly recommend this restaurant.",2012-05-01,0,5,Friday,May
"Good, not Extraordinary",JeffNewYork,0,2012-05-13,"Recently tried Septime. Had HUGE expectations given the hype and articles i had read. Not sure any place could have lived up to the press clippings. Limited menu choices was ok by us. It seemed like they were just trying too hard -- the more unusual the ingredient the better, the more out there the preparation the better, the more different... you get the picture. Seems like a dose of trying to simplify and not innovate for innovation's sake would help. Cool place, really nice servers (excellent staff). Went there the night after Frenchie's expecting a similar experience... didn't happen.",2012-04-01,0,4,Sunday,May
Affordable Tasting Menu & Fantastic Service,MsGlaze,0,2012-05-07,"Septime delivers an industrial cool vibe with impeccable service and an affordable tasting menu. Not to mention a totally awesome wine list and a sommelier who is up for matching by the glass or by the bottle. The tasting menu was a bargain considering the restaurant I cooked at in Paris. There was an unforgivable error in one of my dishes or I would rate this restaurant higher. The chef, who also has an extensive Michelin background prepared focused dishes with beautiful presentation and delicate/orgainic flavor and composition. I wish that the flavors were a bit more ""wow"" but this is France, and attention to subtly and complexity must be noted and appreciated. The baby lettuce garnishes on every dish was a bit overkill. The 'Hay' flavored ice cream at the dessert was off the hook. The service was great – it's nice to be greeted with a big smile!",2012-04-01,0,4,Monday,May
Superb cooking - a must try,JKHR,0,2012-05-07,"We had decided to come here on the basis of reviews, and we were not disappointed. We were just in Paris for lunch, and so we chose the ""Carte blanche"", that is chosen by the chef. I am glad we did. The flavours were fresh, and some of the combinations unusual, but they worked. First course was raw veal served similar to steak tartare, followed by lamb sweetbreads, pollock with various root vegetables,(including parsnip and swede), roast shoulder of lamb, and to end, cheese.

Service was friendly and relaxed, but I suspect that my speaking French did make a difference.

Wine selection is good, including a good selection by the glass, and pleasingly not confined to burgundy/bordeaux standards.

I would thoroughly recommend this restaurant. We wil be back soon I hope",2012-03-01,0,5,Monday,May
"High quality, both in the food and the staff",Litoguti,0,2012-04-24,"We sought out Septime on the recommendation of Alexander Lobrano and we were not disappointed. We arrived for lunch today without a reservation. We were lucky! They accommodated us by the counter and we had a wonderful experience. Clearly a place to come back to, but next time we will make reservations. By the way, when we asked when they could sit us if we wanted to come for dinner, ""late in May"" was the answer.",2012-04-01,1,5,Tuesday,April
You have to try it!,Ole and Aletha H,0,2012-04-19,"If you are in Paris and only have time for one restaurant visit, may it be lunch or dinner, go to Septime. Cozy and atmosphere filled restaurant with the best service we have experienced in Paris which makes you feel welcome right away.
Enjoyed a 3 course lunch and the dishes interesting, tasty and beautifully presented. Limited but good wine selection and great coffee. They definitely follow through with their concept of making haute cuisine affordable.
We will surely be back.",2012-04-01,0,5,Thursday,April
OVER PRICED AND UNDERWHELMING,jspanderp,0,2012-01-25,"This was our second time at this restaurant. The first time we thought it was very good, but a little over priced. This time the food was not as good, and somewhat repetitive, and the service was also lacking. We would not return as there are many other REstaurants which are superior",2012-01-01,1,2,Wednesday,January
Foodie - Shmoodie or All the Locals Eat A La Carte,SSJK,0,2011-12-22,"Just thinking about writing this review is exhausting.
The philosophy is democratic haute cuisine (not my words), the reviews are great - the look is industrial low key hip, which includes its out of the way location, the male wait staff is very friendly and the waitress is a surly parisian caricature, all reasons to make a reservation.
We went for a celebratory dinner. A group of five from Manhattan ranging in age from 13 years old to 74 years old. I would not classify us as foodies but others might.
The adventure of the chef selection is hard to resist if not impossible to choose as the menu is very limited. The waiter went around the table asking what we did not want, assuring us that the chef would honor our request.
The food was not very adventurous. That is not a complaint, just an observation. Tomato salad, shrimp and leeks, chicken roasted and a white flakey fish.
We are not a picky group, we all eat fish, meat, including game, no aversion to any spices, etc. We had three requests. No organ meat, no clams ( I am the only one who dislikes them) and our one unified request was that we do not like raw or undercooked food. While I acknowledge that the definition of raw/undercooked is not the same internationally, this is a sophisticated resto, where the cultural differences in cuisine are known by them as well as us. We were reassured this was not an issue. It was a huge issue!
We opted not to mention the shrimp were raw, intentional or not we were not sure as one dish was fully cooked. No one ate more than one. When the fish dish came it was too raw for all. It was sent back and upon return was cooked enough for 3 out of the 4 of us but was still raw in the center. When asked if one plate could be done a little more, for the 74 year old the request was denied. The waiter was apologetic.
We stayed in good humor, thanks to 2 very good bottles of wine, but were eager to get the meal over with. When the check came, the waiter informed us that the chef purposefully gave us the fish too raw for our liking to see if he could trick us and we would like it anyway. The uneaten shrimp went unnoticed. If you are going to extend the evening knowing that it is likely to be sent back and have us endure more contemptous interaction with the waitress (there are no second seatings in europe, not a turn over issue), it would have been respectful ultimately to cook the fish for us as requested.
All the locals ate a la carte! Now you know why.",2011-09-01,9,2,Thursday,December
More show than soul,Donn S,0,2011-11-14,"At lunch, the woman next to us had a dessert that included a 4-inch stripe of fromage blanc topped with a shortbread cookie of the same dimensions. We had the same dessert about a half-hour later. Our fromage blanc was served in a series of dollops accompanied by shards of shortbread. Obviously, their cookie crumbled. There is an obvious appreciation of ingredients and the counterplays that can be achieved. For all that, however, the results seem more style than substance, more show than soul. Located on rue Charonne, Septime is worth the walk. Just don't expect to be transported.",2011-11-01,0,3,Monday,November
Enjoyed Our Evening,TorontoTraveller2010,14,2011-10-31,"Paris is so unpredictable. And, surprisingly hard to get a good meal sometimes. Septime was a pleasure. The staff was welcoming. The food appetizing and interesting. The room was charming. Modern French cuisine.",2011-10-01,1,4,Monday,October
"If you are a foodie, this place is for you",jld94114,0,2011-10-27,"Based on research I made advance reservations for Septime, it was quite an experience.
The restaurant is pretty far out of the way, so give yourself time to find it.
We were greeted and seated with friendly service and smiles. The menu in french of course is very limited, and the server explains that the table can leave it all up to the chef and have a wonderful 5 course meal, but you won't know what you are getting until it arrives on your talbe. After a bit of discussion we went with the chefs choice dinner even though my partner is far less adventurous eater than I am. The food as it arrived was like a work of art, unfortunately it was too ""out there"" for my partner and I wound up eating his portion as well as mine for the first course, and for the second course, he managed to eat the next three courses but didn't love it. This is for true foodies. I was able to appreciate the artistry in the kitchen, but the food was a bit much even for me.
In looking around the restaurant, it was filled with beautiful people, and it seemed that every single table had the chef's choice. First course was raw scallops in cider with roe and some other spices. Second course was raw mushrooms shaved with figs, beef broth and some greens. Third course was a fairly raw piece of tuna with shrimp foam that made the tuna taste like salmon...kind of funky. Fourth course was duck - a little gamey. Desert was a pumpkin mouse and praline flavor ice cream..
I would never choose to eat any of these dishes again, but they were beautifully presented.",2011-10-01,2,4,Thursday,October
The Elements Make The Dish,davidrothnc,0,2011-10-07,"Bertrand Grebault's cuisine is a delight. Young, poised and watchful he calmly goes about creating daily riffs on seasonally fresh locally farmed produce. What marks his cuisine is what you might call an 'anti-fusion' approach that, rather than blending flavors into a single taste experience, Grebault wisely knows how to extract and enhance the natural deliciousness of each element and combine these elements to serve plates that are at once artful but complex in a civilized way. You get to taste each part of the dish while enjoying the total experience like the first plate in his 55 euro dinner, Celery Root done three ways with marinated tissue-like shavings flash roasted that heightened the celery flavor, a 'chunk' of the heart of the root served with a root piece attached and long roasted for a deeply nutty and earthy slightly smoky flavor, and a foam made from the leaves of the celery root that balanced the dish with a touch of sweetness and acidity. Octopus cooked a la Plancha was plated with a long leek like green also done la Plancha with a single tiny pickled cucumber and a most unctuous, dark and dense homemade 'olive oil' that was like a reduction of olive that brilliantly added a salt brine quality perfect for the octopus. At 55 Euro (have them match each course with wonderfully selected, unusual and affordable wines) the menu is affordable and a value considering the quality of the food, the charAnanda downright friendliness of the service and the exceptional thought that goes into each dish. Get to know Grebault now.",2011-09-01,1,5,Friday,October
Best meal in Paris,Middlespahr,19,2011-09-22,"We just completed the chef tasting menu at Septime and it was one course after another of creative fresh cuisine.

"Creative menu, good food, but doesn't deserve the hype",RGSOUNDF,0,2011-09-11,"We visited this new restaurant, much talked-about, on a September Friday, for a rather late lunch at 1:30 PM. The place was packed as it was expected after all the glowing reviews it received. We loved the interior, a mix of the minimalistic design and rustic French countryside. The lunch formula of 28 euros offered just a few choices, something about two appetizer choices and two main course choices, including a glass of wine but no coffee. Our appetizers were the grilled octopus and the velouté. The octopus was good, and even close to be labeled extraordinary and so was the pumpkin velouté, quite agreeable but kind of spoiled with excessive amount of yolk. For our main course we and our friend ordered the merlu, which we believe is the hake. It was unusual too but a bit undercooked. Our dessert was a combination of figs, grapes and macaroons (we think :) ), beautifully if not artistically presented. The service is very friendly, you can use the restaurant's Wi-Fi, so overall it was an interesting experience. Unfortunately, after all the amazing reviews including one by the very selective Alexander Lobrano, we expected a little bit more than just an interesting experience. Overall, the eclectic menu sometimes felt as being eclectic just for the sake of it.",2011-09-01,4,4,Sunday,September
